# Transactions and ObjectIds

In the .NET API, code that reads and writes to root Civil documents need to use an `Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.TransactionManager` object to start and commit transactions. It’s a best practice to manage a `Transaction` with a `Using` statement, which automatically disposes the Transaction at the end of the block; otherwise, the `Transaction` should be explicitly disposed of in the `Finally` section of a `Try-Finally` block. Here’s an example of a `Transaction` in a `Using` block:

```
using (Transaction trans=TransactionManager.StartTransaction())
{
  //operation here
  trans.Commit();
}
```

Note:

See the section "Use Transactions With the Transaction Manager (.NET)" in the AutoCAD .NET Developer’s Guide for more information about using the `Transaction` object to open and modify drawing database objects.

In the .NET API, objects that you get from collections are, in most cases, type `ObjectId`, which have to be cast to their intended type using a `Transaction` object (returned by `TransactionManager.StartTransaction()`). Here’s an example:

```
m_AligmentStyleId = m_doc.Styles.AlignmentStyles.Item(sStyleName)
oAlignmentStyle = m_trans.GetObject(m_AligmentStyleId, OpenMode.ForWrite) As AlignmentStyle
```
