# Adding Points to Point Groups with Queries

Points can be selected and added to a PointGroup using either a standard (`StandardPointGroupQuery` object) or custom (`CustomPointGroupQuery` object) query, which both inherit from the `PointGroupQuery` base class.

`StandardPointGroupQuery` encapsulates the “basic method” of creating a query using the GUI, which is described in the “Creating a Point Group Using the Basic Method” section of the Civil 3D User Guide. This method uses the tabs on the Create Point Group dialog to match points by raw descriptions, include or exclude specific points or ranges of points, and to include points from other point groups. To accomplish the same effect using the API, you first create an instance of a `StandardPointGroupQuery` object, and then set the various `Include*` and `Exclude*` properties to create the query.

`StandardPointGroupQuery` has these properties for building a query:

`StandardPointGroupQuery` Properties

| Properties | Possible Values |
| --- | --- |
| `IncludeElevations`  `ExcludeElevations` | Any combination of, separated by commas:   * A single number * An elevation range specified by a lower and upper bound separated by a hyphen (for example, 1-100) * A > or < followed by a number. This specifies all elevations greater-than or less-than the number.   **Example**: “<-100,1-100,110.01,>200” – specifies all points whose elevations meet one of the following criteria: less than -100, equal to or between 1 and 100, equal to 110.01, or greater than 200. |
| `IncludeFullDescriptions`  `ExcludeFullDescriptions`  `IncludeRawDescriptions`  `ExcludeRawDescriptions` | One or more descriptions, separated by commas. The \* is a wildcard matching any string.  **Example**: “IP\*” matches all descriptions that start with IP |
| `IncludeNames`  `ExcludeNames` | One or more point names separated by commas. The \* is a wildcard matching any string. |
| `IncludeNumbers`  `ExcludeNumbers` | Any combination of, separated by commas:   * An individual point number * A Point number range specified by a lower and upper bound separated by a hyphen (for example, 100-105). |

All of the `Include*` properties are ORed together, and all the `Exclude*` properties are ORed together to create the final query string. The example below illustrates how the query string is built from properties:

```
// _civildoc is the active CivilDocument instance.
ObjectId pointGroupId = _civildoc.PointGroups.Add("Example Point Group1");
PointGroup pointGroup = pointGroupId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) as PointGroup;

StandardPointGroupQuery standardQuery = new StandardPointGroupQuery();
standardQuery.IncludeElevations = "100-200";
standardQuery.IncludeFullDescriptions = "FLO*";
standardQuery.IncludeNumbers = ">2200";
standardQuery.ExcludeElevations = "150-155";
standardQuery.ExcludeNames = "BRKL";
standardQuery.UseCaseSensitiveMatch = true;

pointGroup.SetQuery(standardQuery);
pointGroup.Update();

_editor.WriteMessage("Number of points selected: {0}\n  Query string: {1}\n\n",
    pointGroup.PointsCount, standardQuery.QueryString);

// output:
// Query string: (FullDescription='FLO*' OR PointElevation=100-200 OR 
// PointNumber>2200) AND '' NOT (Name='BRKL' OR PointElevation=150-155)
```

The `CustomPointGroupQuery` lets you specify a query string directly, and requires a more advanced knowledge of query operators. This method of query creation allows you to create nested queries that cannot be specified using the `StandardPointGroupQuery` object.

Custom queries are made up of expressions, and expressions have three parts:

1. A property
2. A comparison operator: > < >= <= =
3. A value

Multiple expressions are separated by logical set operators: AND, OR and NOT. Precedence of expressions and expression sets can be specified using parentheses.

The precedence of evaluation in queries is:

1. Expressions in parentheses, with the innermost expressions evaluated first.
2. NOT
3. Comparisons
4. AND
5. OR

The example below illustrates creating a point group and adding a custom query to it:

```
ObjectId pointGroupId2 = _civildoc.PointGroups.Add("Example Point Group2");
PointGroup pointGroup2 = pointGroupId2.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) as PointGroup;
CustomPointGroupQuery customQuery = new CustomPointGroupQuery();
string queryString = "(RawDescription='GR*') AND (PointElevation>=100 AND PointElevation<=300)";
customQuery.QueryString = queryString;
pointGroup2.SetQuery(customQuery);
pointGroup2.Update();
_editor.WriteMessage("PointGroup2: \n # points selected: {0}\n",
    pointGroup2.PointsCount);
```

Pending changes for a `PointGroup` can be accessed from the `PointGroup.GetPendingChanges()` method, which returns a `PointGroupChangeInfo` object. The pending change information for a `PointGroup` is updated when:

* A new point is added to the drawing that matches the query for the `PointGroup.`
* An existing point in the `PointGroup` is removed.

Note that changes are not registered when the query itself is changed.

The example below adds a point that matches the custom query illustrated above, and removes a point from the `PointGroup`, registering both an added and removed point change in the `PointGroupChangeInfo` for the `PointGroup.`

```
Point3d point3d = new Point3d(100,200,225); // elevation will be matched
string rawDesc = "GRND"; // raw description will be matched
_civildoc.CogoPoints.Add(point3d, rawDesc);

// Point # 779 is in the point group:
_civildoc.CogoPoints.Remove(779);

PointGroupChangeInfo pointGroupChangeInfo = pointGroup2.GetPendingChanges();
_editor.WriteMessage("Point group {0} pending changes: \n add: {1} \n remove: {2}\n",
    pointGroup2.Name, pointGroupChangeInfo.PointsToAdd.Length, pointGroupChangeInfo.PointsToRemove.Length);

// changes are applied with update:
pointGroup2.Update();
```
