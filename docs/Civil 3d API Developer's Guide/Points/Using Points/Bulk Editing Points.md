# Bulk Editing Points

The `CogoPointCollection` class provides several methods for changing the properties of multiple points with a single action. Most of the `Set<Property>()` methods have three versions:

1. Set the property for a single `CogoPoint` (identified by `ObjectId`) in the collection .
2. Set the property for all points in a list to a single value .
3. Set the property for all points in a list to a value in a corresponding list of values.

The list of points can be a sub-collection of points, or you can pass the `CivilDocument.CogoPoints` collection to process all points in the document.

Here is an example of setting `Elevation`, `RawDescription` and `DescriptionFormat` properties for all points in the drawing using the bulk editing methods.

```
// Change a couple of properties using bulk editing methods
cogoPoints.SetElevationByOffset(cogoPoints, 3.00);
cogoPoints.SetRawDescription(cogoPoints, "NEW_DESC");
// Sets Full Description = Raw Description:
cogoPoints.SetDescriptionFormat(cogoPoints, "$*");
```
