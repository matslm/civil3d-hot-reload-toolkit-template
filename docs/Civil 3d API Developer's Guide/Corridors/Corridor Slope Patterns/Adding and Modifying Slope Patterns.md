# Adding and Modifying Slope Patterns

A slope pattern is a pattern that is applied to the area between two Corridor feature lines (typically, between a grading footprint and daylight line) to indicate the direction of slope. A Corridor's collection of `SlopePattern` objects is held in its `SlopePatterns` collection. This collection also exposes an `Add()` method that allows you to add a new `SlopePattern` defined by two `CorridorFeatureLine` objects and the `ObjectId` for a `SlopePatternStyle`. Once the `SlopePattern` has been added, its start and end stations can be set.

In this example, all existing slope patterns are listed, and then a new `SlopePattern` is added to the corridor, and its stations are set.

```
// add slope pattern
CorridorFeatureLine featureLine1 = null;
CorridorFeatureLine featureLine2 = null;
string fl1name = "ETW";
string f2name = "Ditch_Out";

Baseline baseline = corridor.Baselines[0];
foreach (FeatureLineCollection fl in baseline.MainBaselineFeatureLines.FeatureLineCollectionMap)
{
    foreach (CorridorFeatureLine cfl in fl)
    {
        if (cfl.CodeName == fl1name)
        {
            featureLine1 = cfl;
            break;
        }
        if (cfl.CodeName == f2name)
        {
            featureLine2 = cfl;
            break;
        }
    }
}

// get a style for the slope pattern:
ObjectId slopePatterStyleId = _civilDoc.Styles.SlopePatternStyles["Standard"];

CorridorSlopePattern pattern = corridor.SlopePatterns.Add(featureLine1, featureLine2, slopePatterStyleId);
// set the stations:
_editor.WriteMessage("First station: {0} \nEnd station: {1}\n", baseline.StartStation, baseline.EndStation);
pattern.StartStation = baseline.StartStation;
pattern.EndStation = baseline.EndStation;
```
