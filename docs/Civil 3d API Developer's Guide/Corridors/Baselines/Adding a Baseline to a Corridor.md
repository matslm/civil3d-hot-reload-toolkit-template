# Adding a Baseline to a Corridor

The `BaselineCollection` class allows you to add a new Baseline to a Corridor using the `Add()` method. There are two versions of this method. One takes the name of the new `Baseline`, the `ObjectId` of the `Alignment`, and the `ObjectId` of a `Profile`. The second takes the name of the new `Baseline`, the name of the `Alignment`, and the name of a `Profile.`

In this example, a corridor is selected by name, and the first alignment in the document and the first profile in the alignment are used to create a baseline.

```
// use on a document with at least one alignment, and one profile for the alignment
// EG: Corridor-5b.dwg in the tutorials directory
string corridorName = "Corridor - (1)";
Corridor corridor = ts.GetObject(_civildoc.CorridorCollection[corridorName], OpenMode.ForWrite) as Corridor;

// Get the ObjectId of an alignment and profile
ObjectId alignmentId = _civildoc.GetAlignmentIds()[0];
Alignment alignment = ts.GetObject(alignmentId, OpenMode.ForRead) as Alignment;
ObjectId profileId = alignment.GetProfileIds()[0];

Baseline baseline = corridor.Baselines.Add("New Baseline", alignmentId, profileId);
```
