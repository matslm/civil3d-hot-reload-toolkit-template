# Accessing and Modifying Baseline Stations

Assembly cross sections are placed at regular intervals along a baseline. The list of all stations where assemblies are located along a baseline can be retrieved using the `Baseline.SortedStations()` method, while all stations along a baseline region can be retrieved using the `BaselineRegion.SortedStations()` method.

```
double[] stations = oBaselineRegion.SortedStations();
ed.WriteMessage("Baseline Region stations: \n");
foreach (double station in stations){
    ed.WriteMessage("\tStation: {0}\n", station);
}
```

New stations can be added to baseline regions using the `AddStation()` method. Existing stations can be deleted using the `DeleteStation` method. `DeleteStation` includes an optional `tolerance` parameter, letting you specify a station within a range. You can list all of the stations added to a baseline region with the `BaselineRegion.GetAdditionalStation` method. `BaselineRegion.ClearAdditionalStations` removes all added stations within a baseline region and leaves only the original stations created at regular intervals.

```
// Add an assembly to the middle of the baseline region
double newStation = oBaselineRegion.StartStation + 
    ((oBaselineRegion.EndStation - oBaselineRegion.StartStation) / 2);
oBaselineRegion.AddStation(newStation, "New Station");
ed.WriteMessage("Added New Station: {0}", newStation);
 
// Remove the station located at the beginning of the baseline region:
oBaselineRegion.DeleteStation(oBaselineRegion.StartStation);
```
