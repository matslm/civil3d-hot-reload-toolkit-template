# Creating Assemblies

Assemblies can be created in a `CivilDocument` with the `AssemblyCollection.Add()` method. This method takes the name of the newly created `Assembly`, the `Assembly` type (using the `AssemblyType` enum), and the `Point3d` location in the drawing to insert the new `Assembly`. You can optionally specify the `ObjectId` of the `AssemblyStyle` and `CodeSetStyle` to apply to the `Assembly`.

In the sample below, a new, empty `Assembly` is created in the `CivilDocument`'s `AssemblyCollection` using a `Point3d` entered by the user.

```
// Add a new assembly
Point3d location = _editor.GetPoint("Select assembly location").Value;
ObjectId assemblyId = _civilDoc.AssemblyCollection.Add("New Assembly", AssemblyType.DividedPlanarRoad, location);
Assembly assembly = ts.GetObject(assemblyId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as Assembly;
```
