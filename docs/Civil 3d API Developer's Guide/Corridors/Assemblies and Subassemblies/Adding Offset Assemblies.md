# Adding Offset Assemblies

Offset Assemblies are contained in an `Assembly` object's `OffsetAssemblies` collection, and can be added using the `Add()` method. This method takes the name of the new Offset Assembly, and an offset from the `Assembly` as a `Vector2d` object.

In the sample below, a new Offset Assembly is created and added to an `Assembly` object's `OffsetAssemblies` collection.

```
// Add offset assembly
Point3d offsetLocation = _editor.GetPoint("Select offset assembly location").Value;
Point2d location2d = new Point2d(location.X, location.Y);
Point2d offsetLocation2d = new Point2d(offsetLocation.X, offsetLocation.Y);
Vector2d offset = offsetLocation2d - location2d;
assembly.OffsetAssemblies.Add("New Offset Assembly", offset);
```
