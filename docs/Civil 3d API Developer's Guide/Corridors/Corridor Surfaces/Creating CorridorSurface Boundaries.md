# Creating CorridorSurface Boundaries

There are several ways to add a new boundary to a `CorridorSurface`, using versions of the `CorridorSurfaceBoundaryCollection.Add()` method. This method allows you to add a new boundary in several ways:

1. - As a new, empty boundary;
2. - From a polyline;
3. - From a collection of `Point3d` objects;
4. - From a feature line.

You can also add a new outer boundary using `AddCorridorExtentsBoundary()`. This method corresponds to adding a new boundary using the "Corridor Extents As Outer Boundary" command in the UI.

You can also examine existing boundaries to determine how they were created. Outer boundaries created with `AddCorridorExtentsBoundary()` have the `IsCorridorExtents` property set to true, while boundaries created from polylines and Point3d collections have the `IsDefinedFromPolygon` set to true.

In the code sample below, we prompt for a corridor surface name, and then add three types of boundary to its Boundaries collection: an empty boundary defined by corridor extents, an outer boundary, and a boundary from a polyline.

```
Corridor corridor = null;
CorridorSurface corridorSurface = null;

string surfaceName = _editor.GetString("Enter Corridor Surface name: ").StringResult;
// With surface name, find surface and associated corridor ID
foreach (ObjectId oid in _civilDoc.CorridorCollection)
{
    Corridor c = ts.GetObject(oid, OpenMode.ForWrite) as Corridor;
    if (c.CorridorSurfaces[surfaceName] != null)
    {
        // this is the matching surface and corridor
        corridor = c;
        corridorSurface = c.CorridorSurfaces[surfaceName];
	break;
    }
}

// add outer boundary:
CorridorSurfaceBoundary outerBoundary = corridorSurface.Boundaries. AddCorridorExtentsBoundary("OuterBoundary");

_editor.WriteMessage("New outer boundary has {0} polygon points.", outerBoundary.PolygonPoints().Length);

// add empty boundary:
CorridorSurfaceBoundary emptyBoundary = corridorSurface.Boundaries.Add("EmptyBoundary");

// prompt for polyline to add as boundary:
ObjectId polylineId = promptForObjectType("Select a polyline to add to the surface boundary collection:", typeof(Polyline));
CorridorSurfaceBoundary polyBoundary = corridorSurface.Boundaries.Add("Polyline boundary", polylineId);

ts.Commit();
```
