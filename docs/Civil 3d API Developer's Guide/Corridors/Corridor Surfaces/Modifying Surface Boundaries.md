# Modifying Surface Boundaries

Some properties of `CorridorSurfaceBoundary` objects can be modified after the boundary is added or created. The polygon points for all types of `CorridorSurfaceBoundary` objects are read-only. However, the feature line components of `CorrdiorSurfaceBoundary` objects defined by feature lines can be modified. Other properties for both types of `CorridorSurfaceBoundaries` may be modified, such as the `Name`, and `Description`. The `BoundaryType` cannot be modified.

The example below illustrates setting modifying some of the properties of an existing `CorridorSurfaceBoundary`:

```
string corridorName = "Corridor - (1)";
string corridorSurfaceName = "Corridor - (1) Top";
string boundaryName = "Corridor Boundary(1)";

// With surface name, find surface and associated corridor ID
Corridor corridor = ts.GetObject( _civilDoc.CorridorCollection[corridorName], OpenMode.ForWrite) as Corridor;
CorridorSurface corridorSurface = corridor.CorridorSurfaces[corridorSurfaceName];
// Get a boundary
                 
CorridorSurfaceBoundary corridorSurfaceBoundary = corridorSurface.Boundaries[boundaryName];
corridorSurfaceBoundary.Description = "A modified description";
corridorSurfaceBoundary.Name = "A modified boundary name";
```
