# Creating a Surface from a Corridor Surface

When you create a `CorridorSurface`, a linked `Surface` with the same name is created in the document's collection of surfaces. However, because this Surface is an output of the corridor model, it is dynamically linked to the `CorridorSurface`, and if the `CorridorSurface` is removed, the related `Surface` is as well. To create an independent `Surface` object from a `CorridorSurface`, you can use the `TinSurface.CreateFromCorridorSurface()` method, which is analogous to exporting a surface in the UI using the "Create Surface From Corridor" command. This static method takes the name to assign the new, independent surface, and a reference to a `CorridorSurface` object to create the new surface from.

In the example below, a new Surface is created from a `CorridorSurface`, and then the source `CorridorSurface` is removed. However, the count of Surfaces in the document stays the same before and after the removal, showing that the independent Surface is not removed.

```
string corridorSurfaceName = "Corridor - (1) Top";
string corridorName = "Corridor - (1)";

// get the CorridorSurface by name:
ObjectId corridorId = _civilDoc.CorridorCollection[corridorName];
Corridor corridor = ts.GetObject(corridorId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as Corridor;
CorridorSurface corridorSurface = corridor.CorridorSurfaces[corridorSurfaceName];

// Count the number of surfaces:
_editor.WriteMessage("# of existing surfaces: {0}\n", _civilDoc.GetSurfaceIds().Count);
ObjectId surfaceId = TinSurface.CreateFromCorridorSurface("New Surface", corridorSurface);

corridor.CorridorSurfaces.Remove(corridorSurface);

// Even though the CorridorSurface is removed, surface count remains the same:
_editor.WriteMessage("# of existing surfaces after CorridorSurface removal: {0}\n", _civilDoc.GetSurfaceIds().Count);
```
