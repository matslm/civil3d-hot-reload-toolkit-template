# Listing Surface Boundaries

Two different objects are used to define the limits of a corridor surface: boundaries and masks. A boundary is a polygon representing the outer edge of a surface or the inside edge of a hole in a surface. A mask is a polygon representing the part of the surface that can be displayed. The collection of all the boundaries of a surface are stored in the `CorridorSurface.Boundaries` property and the collection of all masks are stored in the `CorridorSurface.Masks` property.

Boundaries (of type `CorridorSurfaceBoundary`) and masks (of type `CorridorSurfaceMask`) are both derived from the same base class (`CorridorSurfaceBaseMask`) and both have similar methods and properties. The array of points making up the border polygon is retrieved by calling the `PolygonPoints()` method. If the border was originally defined by selecting segments of feature lines, the collection of all such feature line components are contained in the `FeatureLineComponents` property.

See [Modifying Suface Boundaries](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-FF66838C-91AD-4248-A365-FCD1F62337EE.htm) for information about how to modify Corridor surface boundaries and masks.

This sample loops through all the boundaries of a corridor surface and displays information about each:

```
// List boundaries
foreach (CorridorSurfaceBoundary oCorridorSurfaceBoundary in oCorridorSurface.Boundaries)
{
    if (oCorridorSurfaceBoundary.BoundaryType == CorridorSurfaceBoundaryType.InsideBoundary)
        ed.WriteMessage("Inner Boundary: ");
    else
        ed.WriteMessage("Outer Boundary: ");
 
    ed.WriteMessage(oCorridorSurfaceBoundary.Name);
 
    // Get the points of the boundary polygon
    Point3d[] oPoints = oCorridorSurfaceBoundary.PolygonPoints();
    ed.WriteMessage("\nNumber of points: {0}\n", oPoints.Length);
    // Print the location of the first point. Usually corridors
    // have a large number of boundary points, so we will not
    // bother printing all of them.
    ed.WriteMessage("Point 1: {0},{1},{2}\n",
        oPoints[0][0],
        oPoints[0][1],
        oPoints[0][2]);
 
    // Display information about each feature
    // line component in this surface boundary.
    ed.WriteMessage("Feature line components \n Count: {0}\n",
        oCorridorSurfaceBoundary.FeatureLineComponents.Count);
 
    foreach (FeatureLineComponent oFeatureLineComponent in oCorridorSurfaceBoundary.FeatureLineComponents)
    {
        ed.WriteMessage("Code: {0}, Start station: {1}, End station: {2}\n",
            oFeatureLineComponent.FeatureLine.CodeName,
            oFeatureLineComponent.StartStation,
            oFeatureLineComponent.EndStation);
    }
}
```
