# Setting the Graph Style

The graph is managed by objects of type `GraphStyle` and `GridStyle`. These objects can be used to change the scale, title, and grid of the graph.

The grid is controlled by the `ProfileViewStyle.GridStyle` property, an object of type `GridStyle`. The grid style sets the amount of empty space above and below the extents of the section through the `GridStyle.GridPaddingAbove` and `GridStyle.GridPaddingBottom` properties. The grid style also manages the line styles of major and minor vertical and horizontal gridlines with the `DisplayStyle.PlotStyle` property accessed by the `GetDisplayStylePlan()` method.

## Graph Title

The title of the graph is controlled by the `GraphStyle.TitleStyle` property, an object of type `GraphTitleStyle`. The title style object can adjust the position, style, and border of the title. The text of the title can include any of the following property fields:

| Valid property fields for GraphTitleStyle.Text |
