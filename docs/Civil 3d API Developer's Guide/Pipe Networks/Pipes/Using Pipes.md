# Using Pipes

To make a new pipe a meaningful part of a pipe network, it must be connected to structures or other pipes using the `Pipe.ConnectToStructure()` or `Pipe.ConnectToPipe()` methods, or structures must be connected to it using the `Structure.ConnectToPipe()` method. Connecting pipes together directly creates a new virtual `Structure` object to serve as the joint. If a pipe end is connected to a structure, it must be disconnected before attempting to connect it to a different structure. After a pipe has been connected to a network, you can determine the structures at either end by using the `StartStructureId` and `EndStructureId` properties. There are methods and properties for setting and determining the flow direction, getting all types of physical measurements, and for accessing collections of user-defined properties for custom descriptions of the pipe.
