# Creating Pipes

Pipe objects represent the conduits of the pipe network. Pipes are created using the pipe network’s methods for creating either straight or curved pipes, `AddLinePipe()` and `AddCurvePipe()`. Both methods require you to specify a particular part family (using the ObjectId of a family) and a particular part size filter object as well as the geometry of the pipe.

This sample creates a straight pipe between two hard-coded points using the first pipe family and pipe size filter it can find in the part list:

```
[CommandMethod("AddPipe")]
public void AddPipe()
{
    CivilDocument doc = CivilApplication.ActiveDocument;
    Editor ed = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Editor;
    using (Transaction ts = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.
        Database.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())
    {
        ObjectIdCollection oIdCollection = doc.GetPipeNetworkIds();
        // Get the first network in the document
        ObjectId objId = oIdCollection[0];
        Network oNetwork = ts.GetObject(objId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as Network;
        ed.WriteMessage("Pipe Network: {0}\n", oNetwork.Name);
        // Go through the list of part types and select the first pipe found
        ObjectId pid = oNetwork.PartsListId;
        PartsList pl = ts.GetObject(pid, OpenMode.ForWrite) as PartsList;
        ObjectId oid = pl["Concrete Pipe"];
        PartFamily pfa = ts.GetObject(oid, OpenMode.ForWrite) as PartFamily;
        ObjectId psize = pfa[0];
        LineSegment3d line = new LineSegment3d(new Point3d(30, 9, 0), new Point3d(33, 7, 0));
        ObjectIdCollection col = oNetwork.GetPipeIds();
        ObjectId oidNewPipe = ObjectId.Null;
        oNetwork.AddLinePipe(oid, psize, line, ref oidNewPipe, false);
        Pipe oNewPipe = ts.GetObject(oidNewPipe, OpenMode.ForRead) as Pipe;                
        ed.WriteMessage("Pipe created: {0}\n", oNewPipe.DisplayName);
        ts.Commit();
    }
    
}
```
