# Creating a Pipe Network

A pipe network is a set of interconnected or related parts. The collection of all pipe networks is returned by the `CivilDocument.GetPipeNetworkIds()` method. A pipe network, an object of type `Network`, contains the collection of pipes and the collection of structures which make up the network. `Network` also contains the method `FindShortestNetworkPath()` for determining the path between two network parts.

The `Network.ReferenceSurfaceId` is used primarily for Pipe Rules. For example, you can have a rule that places the structure rim at a specified elevation from the surface.

```
Public Function CreatePipeNetwork() As Boolean
    Dim trans As Transaction = tm.StartTransaction()
    Dim oPipeNetworkIds As ObjectIdCollection
    Dim oNetworkId As ObjectId
    Dim oNetwork As Network
    oNetworkId = Network.Create(g_oDocument, NETWORK_NAME)
    ' get the network
    Try
        oNetwork = trans.GetObject(oNetworkId, OpenMode.ForWrite)
    Catch
        CreatePipeNetwork = False
        Exit Function
    End Try
    '
    'Add pipe and Structure
    ' Get the Networks collections
    oPipeNetworkIds = g_oDocument.GetPipeNetworkIds()
    If (oPipeNetworkIds Is Nothing) Then
        MsgBox("There is no PipeNetwork Collection." + Convert.ToChar(10))
        ed.WriteMessage("There is no PipeNetwork Collection." + Convert.ToChar(10))
        CreatePipeNetwork = False
        Exit Function
    End If
    Dim oPartsListId As ObjectId = g_oDocument.Styles.PartsListSet(PARTS_LIST_NAME) 'Standard PartsList
    Dim oPartsList As PartsList = trans.GetObject(oPartsListId, OpenMode.ForWrite)
    Dim oidPipe As ObjectId = oPartsList("Concrete Pipe SI")
    Dim opfPipe As PartFamily = trans.GetObject(oidPipe, OpenMode.ForWrite)
    Dim psizePipe As ObjectId = opfPipe(0)
    Dim line As LineSegment3d = New LineSegment3d(New Point3d(30, 9, 0), New Point3d(33, 7, 0))
    Dim oidNewPipe As ObjectId = ObjectId.Null
    oNetwork.AddLinePipe(oidPipe, psizePipe, line, oidNewPipe, True)
    Dim oidStructure As ObjectId = oPartsList("CMP Rectangular End Section SI")
    Dim opfStructure As PartFamily = trans.GetObject(oidStructure, OpenMode.ForWrite)
    Dim psizeStructure As ObjectId = opfStructure(0)
    Dim startPoint As Point3d = New Point3d(30, 9, 0)
    Dim endPoint As Point3d = New Point3d(33, 7, 0)
    Dim oidNewStructure As ObjectId = ObjectId.Null
    oNetwork.AddStructure(oidStructure, psizeStructure, startPoint, 0, oidNewStructure, True)
    oNetwork.AddStructure(oidStructure, psizeStructure, endPoint, 0, oidNewStructure, True)
    ed.WriteMessage("PipeNetwork created" + Convert.ToChar(10))
    trans.Commit()
    CreatePipeNetwork = True
End Function ' CreatePipeNetwork
