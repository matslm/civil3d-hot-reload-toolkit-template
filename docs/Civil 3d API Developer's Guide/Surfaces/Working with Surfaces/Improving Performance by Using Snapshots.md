# Improving Performance by Using Snapshots

A surface is made up of all the operations that modifiy the surface’s triangles. If you rebuild the surface, re-performing all these operations can be slow. Snapshots can improve performance by recording the current state of all the triangles in a surface. Subsequent rebuilds start from the data of the snapshot, thus saving time by not performing complicated calculations that have already been done once. Surface objects have `CreateSnapshot()`, `RebuildSnapshot()`, and `RemoveSnapshot()` methods. Both `CreateSnapshot()` and `RebuildSnapshot()` will overwrite an existing snapshot.

Note:

`RebuildSnapshot()` will cause an error if the snapshot does not exist. `CreateSnapshot()` and `RebuildSnapshot()` can also cause errors if the surface is out-of-date. You can check whether the Surface has a snapshot already with the `Surface.HasSnapshot` property. For example:

```
if (oSurface.HasSnapshot)
{
    oSurface.RemoveSnapshot();
}
oSurface.CreateSnapshot();
oSurface.RebuildSnapshot();
```
