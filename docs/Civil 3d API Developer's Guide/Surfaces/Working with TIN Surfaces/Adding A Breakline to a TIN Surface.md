# Adding A Breakline to a TIN Surface

Breaklines are used to shape the triangulation of a TIN surface. Each TIN surface has a collection of breaklines contained in the `TinSurface.BreaklinesDefinition` property, which is a `SurfaceDefinitionBreaklines` object. There are different kinds of breaklines, and each is created in a slightly different way.

Note: For more information about breakline types, see the Autodesk Civil 3D User’s Guide.

The `SurfaceDefinitionBreaklines` class allows you to add standard, non-destructive, and proximity breaklines in similar ways. Each breakline type has its own `Add*()` method (for example, `AddStandardBreaklines` for standard breaklines), and each method has three versions, depending on the type of object you are creating a breakline from. You can add breaklines from a `Point2dCollection`, a `Point3dCollection`, or an `ObjectIdCollection` that contains one or more 3D lines, grading feature lines, splines, or 3D polylines. Each type of breakline requires a specified mid-ordinate distance parameter, which determines how curves are tessellated.

A **standard breakline** consists of an array of 3D lines or polylines. Each line endpoint becomes a point in the surface and surface triangles around the breakline are redone. The `AddStandardBreaklines()` method requires that you specify the maximum distance, weeding distance and weeding angle, in addition to the mid-ordinate distance. The `maximumDistance` parameter corresponds to the Supplementing Distance in the Autodesk Civil 3D GUI, while `weedingDistance` and `weedingAngle` correspond to the weeding distance and angle, respectively.

A **proximity breakline** does not add new points to a surface. Instead, the nearest surface point to each breakline endpoint is used. The triangles that make up a surface are then recomputed making sure those points are connected.

A **non-destructive breakline** does not remove any triangle edges. It places new points along the breakline at each intersection with a triangle edge and new triangles are computed.

This example illustrates how to add standard, non-destructive and proximity breaklines:

```
[CommandMethod("SurfaceBreaklines")]
public void SurfaceBreaklines()
{
    using (Transaction ts = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Database.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())
    {
        // Prompt the user to select a TIN surface and a polyline, and create a breakline from the polyline

        ObjectId surfaceId = promptForEntity("Select a TIN surface to add a breakline to", typeof(TinSurface));
        ObjectId lineId = promptForEntity("Select a 3D polyline to use as the breakline", typeof(Polyline3d));
        TinSurface oSurface = surfaceId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) as TinSurface;
        ObjectId[] lines = { lineId };

        PromptKeywordOptions pKeyOpts = new PromptKeywordOptions("");
        pKeyOpts.Message = "\nEnter the type of breakline to create: ";
        pKeyOpts.Keywords.Add("Standard");
        pKeyOpts.Keywords.Add("Non-Destructive");
        pKeyOpts.Keywords.Add("Proximity");
        pKeyOpts.Keywords.Default = "Standard";
        pKeyOpts.AllowNone = true;
        PromptResult pKeyRes = editor.GetKeywords(pKeyOpts);

        try
        {
            switch (pKeyRes.StringResult)
            {
                case "Non-Destructive":
                    oSurface.BreaklinesDefinition.AddNonDestructiveBreaklines(new ObjectIdCollection(lines), 1);
                    break;
                case "Proximity":
                    oSurface.BreaklinesDefinition.AddProximityBreaklines(new ObjectIdCollection(lines), 1);
                    break;
                case "Standard":
                default:
                    oSurface.BreaklinesDefinition.AddStandardBreaklines(new ObjectIdCollection(lines), 10, 5, 5, 0);
                    break;
            }
        }

        catch (System.Exception e)
        {
            editor.WriteMessage("Operation failed: {0}", e.Message);
        }

        // commit the transaction
        ts.Commit();
    }
}
```
