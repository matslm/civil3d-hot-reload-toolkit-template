# Creating a GridSurface with GridSurface.Create()

You can create an empty `GridSurface` using the `GridSurface.Create()` method. There are two overloads of this method: one applies the default `SurfaceStyle`, while the other allows you to specify which `SurfaceStyle` to use. Both take the name of the new `GridSurface`, x and y spacing, and orientation. The units for x and y spacing and orientation are specified in the surface creation ambient settings (`SettingsCmdCreateSurface` Distance and Area properties).

`GridSurface` objects are defined on a regularly-spaced grid, and each location on the grid (represented by the GridLocation structure) has a row index and column index. The grid address (0,0) is at the bottom left corner of the grid.

The following example creates a new, empty `GridSurface` with 25’ x 25’ spacing, and then iterates through a 10 x 10 grid and adds a random elevation at each sample location:

```
[CommandMethod("CreateGridSurface")]
public void CreateGridSurface()
{
    using (Transaction ts = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Database.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())
    {
        string surfaceName = "ExGridSurface";
        // Select a surface style to use 
        ObjectId surfaceStyleId = doc.Styles.SurfaceStyles["Slope Banding (2D)"];

        // Create the surface with grid spacing of 25' x 25', orientation 0 degrees:
        ObjectId surfaceId = GridSurface.Create(surfaceName, 25, 25, 0.0, surfaceStyleId);
        GridSurface surface = surfaceId.GetObject(OpenMode.ForWrite) as GridSurface;

        // Add some random elevations
        Random m_Generator = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
            {                        
                double z = m_Generator.NextDouble() * 10;
                GridLocation loc = new GridLocation(i, j);
                surface.AddPoint(loc, z);
            }
        }

        // commit the create action
        ts.Commit();
    }
}
```
