# Specifying Design Speeds

You can assign design speeds along the length of an alignment to aid in the future design of a roadway based on the alignment. The collection of speeds along an alignment are contained in the `Alignment::DesignSpeeds` property. Each item in the collection is an object of type `DesignSpeed`, which contains a raw station value, a speed to be used from that station on until the next specified design speed or the end of the alignment, the design speed number, and an optional string comment.

```
// Starting at station 0 + 00.00
DesignSpeed myDesignSpeed = myAlignment.DesignSpeeds.Add(0, 45);
myDesignSpeed.Comment = "Straigtaway";
// Starting at station 4 + 30.00
myDesignSpeed = myAlignment.DesignSpeeds.Add(430, 30);
myDesignSpeed.Comment = "Start of curve";
// Starting at station 14 + 27.131 to the end
myDesignSpeed = myAlignment.DesignSpeeds.Add(1427.131, 35);
myDesignSpeed.Comment = "End of curve";
// make alignment design speed-based:
myAlignment.UseDesignSpeed = true;
```
