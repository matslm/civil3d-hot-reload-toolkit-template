# Alignment Label Styles

The style of text labels and graphical markers displayed along an alignment are set by specifying a LabelSet (by name or ObjectID) when the alignment is first created with one of the `Alignment::Create()` methods, or by assigning the label set object to the `CivilDocument.Styles.LabelSetStyles.AlignmentLabelSetStyles`  property. The `AlignmentLabelSetStyles` collection consists of separate sets of styles to be placed at major stations, minor stations, and where the alignment geometry, design speed, or station equations change.

Alignment labels are described in the `AlignmentLabelSetStyle` collection, which is a collection of `AlignmentLabelSetItem` objects. Labels at major stations are described by `AlignmentLabelSetItem` objects with a `LabelStyleType` property of `LabelStyleType.AlignmentMajorStation`. Minor station labels are described by `AlignmentLabelSetItem` objects with a `LabelStyleType` property of `LabelStyleType.AlignmentMinorStation`. Each `AlignmentLabelSetItem` object has a related `LabelStyle` object (which you can get or set with the `LabelStyleId` and `LabelStyleName` properties) and a number of properties describing the limits of the labels and the interval between labels along the alignment. When a new `AlignmentLabelSetItem` is created for a minor station label (using `BaseLabelSetStyle.Add()`), it must reference a parent major station label `AlignmentLabelSetItem` object.

Labels may be placed at the endpoints of each alignment entity. Such labels are controlled through the `AlignmentLabelSetItem.GetLabeledAlignmentGeometryPoints()` and `AlignmentLabelSetItem.GetLabeledAlignmentGeometryPoints()` methods. These methods also access labels at each change in alignment design speeds and station equations. The get method returns a Dictionary hash object: `Dictionary<AlignmentPointType, bool>`, specifiying the location of the geometry point, and the bool indicates whether the point is labeled.

Label text for all label styles at alignment stations is controlled by a `LabelStyle` object’s Text component, which is set by the `LabelStyle.SetComponent()` method. The following list of property fields indicates valid values for the Text component:

| Valid property fields for LabelStyleComponentType.Text Contents |
| --- |
| <[Station Value(Uft|FS|P0|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |
| <[Raw Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |
| <[Northing(Uft|P4|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Easting(Uft|P4|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Design Speed(P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Instantaneous Direction(Udeg|FDMSdSp|MB|P4|RN|DSn|CU|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Perpendicular Direction(Udeg|FDMSdSp|MB|P4|RN|DSn|CU|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Alignment Name(CP)]> |
| <[Alignment Description(CP)]> |
| <[Alignment Length(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Alignment Start Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |
| <[Alignment End Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |

Label styles for minor stations, geometry points, design speeds, and station equations can also use the following property fields:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <[Offset From Major Station(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | Minor stations |
| <[Geometry Point Text(CP)]> | Geometry points |
| <[Geometry Point Entity Before Data(CP)]> | Geometry points |
| <[Geometry Point Entity After Data(CP)]> | Geometry points |
| <[Design Speed Before(P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | Design speeds |
| <[Station Ahead(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> | Station equations |
| <[Station Back(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> | Station equations |
| <[Increase/Decrease(CP)]> | Station equations |
