# Managing the Status of Shortcut Elements

The
`DataShortcutManager` API class replicates the functionality found in the Data Shortcut Manager dialog box using the following methods:

* `GetExportableItemCount()`. Returns the number of exportable objects that can be set as data shortcuts.
* `String GetItemAt(int index)`. Returns the object name at the index position in the list of items.
* `List<int> GetDependentItemsIndexList(int index)`. Returns the list of items that must be exported if an item at the index position is exported. This is likely the list of all parent/grandparent objects. For example, if a profile is selected to export, then its parent alignment would be in the list.
* `int GetParentItemIndex(int index)`. Returns the parent of the item at the index position. For example, if a profile is selected, then the parent would be the alignment.
* `List<int> GetDirectChildrenItemIndexList(int index)`. Returns the list of direct children to the item at the index position.
* `List<int> GetRecursiveChildrenItemsIndexList(int index)`. Returns the list of all descendants of the item at the index position. The complete descendent tree is then exposed in list form for convenience.
* `List<int> GetCurrentlySelectedItemsIndexList()`. Returns the subset of referenced objects from the list of all exportable objects in a data shortcut.
* `bool IsItemAtIndexAlreadyPublished(int index)`. Returns true if an object is already a data shortcut, and false if otherwise.

Note: The
`DataShortcutManager` class does not manage broken links, because this process requires searching and browsing folders to locate correct drawings and files. When a broken link is encountered, the API will throw an exception. When programming with the DataShortcutManager it is important to account for this. Show a message box or an error message to prompt that broken links should be repaired with the user-interface before running the plugin again. Once the links are repaired, the API methods should work properly again.
