# Accessing Drawing, Feature, and Command Settings

Settings apply at three levels in Autodesk Civil 3D:

1. Drawing level: there are drawing-wide settings, such as units and zone, abbreviations, etc. There are also ambient settings, which affect a variety of Autodesk Civil 3D behaviors. While these settings also apply drawing-wide, they can be overridden at the feature or command level.
2. Feature (object) level: ambient settings override drawing level ambient settings for that feature only. There are also feature-specific settings, such as default styles.
3. Command level: ambient settings can be set on a command-by-command basis. These settings override both drawing level and feature level settings.

For more information on settings in general, see [About Settings](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?v=2026&p=CIV3D&l=ENU&accessmode=live&guid=GUID-329DAB7D-2497-45AE-985A-D58720439D8A).

A document’s settings are accessed through the properties of the `SettingsRoot` object, which is obtained from the `Document.Settings` property. This object contains the `DrawingSettings` property (type `SettingsDrawing`), which contains all the top-level ambient settings for the document. It also has the `GetSettings()` method, which gets feature and command settings.

Drawing settings and general ambient settings are in the `Autodesk.Civil.Settings` namespace, while feature and command settings are in the namespace for the related feature. For example, alignment-related ambient and command settings are in the `Autodesk.Civil.Land.Settings` namespace.

The following sample shows how to access the angle settings for alignments:

```
SettingsAlignment alignmentSettings = doc.Settings.GetSettings<SettingsAlignment>();
Autodesk.Civil.Settings.SettingsAmbient.SettingsAngle angleSettings = alignmentSettings.Angle;
ed.WriteMessage(@"Alignment settings:\n  Precision: {0}\n  Rounding: {1}  
Unit: {2}\n  Drop Decimal: {3}\n  DropZeros: {4}\n ",
    angleSettings.Precision.Value, angleSettings.Rounding.Value, 
    angleSettings.Unit.Value, angleSettings.DropDecimalForWholeNumbers.Value, 
    angleSettings.DropLeadingZerosForDegrees.Value);
```

The command settings apply to commands, and correspond to the settings in the Commands folder for each item in the Autodesk Civil 3DToolspace Settings Tab. Each command setting has a corresponding class named `SettingsCmdCommandName`. For example, the settings class corresponding to the `CreateAlignmentLayout` command is `SettingsCmdCreateAlignmentLayout`. As with other types of settings, you use the `CivilDocument.Settings.GetSettings()` method to access command settings objects in the document.

The following snippet determines what the “Alignment Type Option” is for the `CreateAlignmentLayout` command:

```
SettingsCmdCreateAlignmentLayout alignLayoutCmdSettings = doc.Settings.GetSettings<SettingsCmdCreateAlignmentLayout>();         
ed.WriteMessage(@"Alignment Layout Command settings: AlignmentType: {0}  ",
    alignLayoutCmdSettings.AlignmentTypeOption.AlignmentType.Value
   );
```

The result of this code returns the current command setting:
