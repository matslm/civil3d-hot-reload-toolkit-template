# Accessing and Using the Database Object

`CivilDocument` class does not expose the underlying database associated with the document. However, you can access the database from the `AutoCAD Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Database` object. The `Database` object contains references to Autodesk Civil 3D entities, as well as base AutoCAD entities. See the ObjectARX Managed Class Reference in the ObjectARX SDK for information.
