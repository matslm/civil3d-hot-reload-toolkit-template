# Accessing Application and Document Objects

The root object in the Autodesk Civil 3D .NET hierarchy is the `CivilApplication` object. It contains a reference to the currently active document, and information about the running product.

Note:

Unlike the COM API, `CivilApplication` does not inherit from the AutoCAD object `Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application`. Therefore, if you need access to application-level methods and properties (such as the collection of all open documents, information about the main window, etc.), you need to access through the AutoCAD `Application` object. See the ObjectARX Managed Class Reference in the ObjectARX SDK for information about this class.

The active `CivilDocument` object is accessed by importing the `AutodeskCivil.ApplicationServices` namespace, and getting the `CivilApplication.ActiveDocument` property.

This example demonstrates the process of accessing the `CivilApplication` and `CivilDocument` objects:

```
using Autodesk.Civil.ApplicationServices;
namespace CivilSample {
    class CivilExample {
        CivilDocument doc = CivilApplication.ActiveDocument;
    }
}
```
