# The Subassembly Template (SATemplate.vb)

All custom subassemblies are defined as classes that inherit from the `SATemplate` class. `SATemplate` provides four methods that you can override in your own class to provide functionality of your subassembly. They are described in the following table:

| Overridable Method | Purpose for Overriding |
| --- | --- |
| GetLogicalNamesImplement  (input: CorridorState) | Define the list of target parameters that appear in the "Set All Logical Names" dialog box used when creating a corridor model. |
| GetInputParametersImplement  (input: CorridorState) | Define the list of input parameters, including their names, types, and default values. |
| GetOutputParametersImplement  (input: CorridorState) | Define the list of output parameters, including their names, types, and default values. If a parameter is to be used for both input and output, that property is specified in this method. |
| DrawImplement  (input: CorridorState) | **Must be overridden.** Contains the code for accessing parameter values, adjusting the shape of the subassembly, and then adding the points, links, and shapes that make up your subassembly to an existing assembly. |
