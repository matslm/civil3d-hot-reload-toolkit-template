# The Corridor State Object

A reference to an object of type `CorridorState` is passed to each of the `SATemplate` methods you override. The `CorridorState` object is the primary interface between the custom subassembly and the collection of points, links, and shapes of the current assembly which the subassembly is to connect to. It provides references to the current alignment, profile, station, offset, elevation, and style, which may affect the appearance of the subassembly. It also includes several parameter buckets used for collecting parameters of types boolean, long, double, string, alignment, profile, surface, and point. Each parameter is defined by a literal name and a value.

The `CorridorState` methods provide useful calculation functions for corridor design. These include the following:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| IntersectAlignment | Finds the intersection of a cross-sectional line with an offset alignment. |
| IntersectLink | Finds the intersection of a cross-sectional line with a link on the assembly. |
| IntersectSurface | Finds the intersection of a cross-sectional line with a surface. |
| IsAboveSurface | Determines if a subassembly point is above or below a surface. |
| SampleSection | Constructs a set of cross section links from a surface. |
| SoeToXyz  XyzToSoe | Converts between station, offset, elevation coordinates and X,Y,Z coordinates. |
