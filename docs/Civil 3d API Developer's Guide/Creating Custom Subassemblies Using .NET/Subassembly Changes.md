# Subassembly Changes

The “target mapping’ feature in Autodesk Civil 3D 2026 has changed, which affects how custom subassemblies are written. This feature now allows a subassembly to target object types in addition to alignments and profiles associated with the corridor that it requires to define its geometry.

There are four changes to the way you write a custom subassembly:

1. New parameter types in `ParamLogicalNameType`
2. New target collections in `corridorState`
3. Targets are now objects
4. The `CalcAlignmentOffsetToThisAlignment` utility method is changed

## New parameter types in ParamLogicalNameType

A subassembly can now target an offset target and elevation target (instead of an alignment and a profile), which are represented by new parameter types in `ParamLogicalNameType`. If you want to support the new target types in your subassemblies, you need to replace:

* `ParamLogicalNameType.Alignment` with
  + `ParamLogicalNameType.OffsetTarget` — offset targets that are alignments, feature lines, survey figures and AutoCAD polylines OR
  + `ParamLogicalNameType.OffsetTargetPipe` — offset targets that are pipe networks
* `ParamLogicalNameType.Profile` with
  + `ParamLogicalNameType.ElevationTarget` — elevation targets that are profiles, feature lines, survey figures and AutoCAD 3D polylines OR
  + `ParamLogicalNameType.ElevationTargetPipe` — elevation targets that are pipe networks

## New target collections in corridorState

To get the offset and elevation target collections from the `corridorState` object, use `ParamsOffsetTarget` and `ParamsElevationTarget` instead of `ParamsAlignment` and `ParamsProfile`. All the offset targets (including network pipe offset targets) are in `ParamsOffsetTarget`, and all elevation targets (including network pipe elevation targets) are in `ParamsElevationTarget`. Here’s an example from the BasicLaneTransition.vb sample in the [Sample VB.NET Subassembly](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-03ADCEE6-5B64-4BD2-96A2-79A9EC16F73D.htm) section below:

```
        Dim oParamsLong As ParamLongCollection
        oParamsLong = corridorState.ParamsLong
 
        Dim oParamsOffsetTarget As ParamOffsetTargetCollection
        oParamsOffsetTarget = corridorState.ParamsOffsetTarget
```

## Targets are now objects

Targets are now objects, instead of alignment or profile IDs. Now `WidthOffsetTarget` is defined for offset targets, and `SlopeElevationTarget` is defined for elevation targets, so you can declare targets as objects instead of IDs. Here’s an example from the BasicLaneTransition.vb sample in the [Sample VB.NET Subassembly](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-03ADCEE6-5B64-4BD2-96A2-79A9EC16F73D.htm) section below:

```
        Dim offsetTarget As WidthOffsetTarget 'width or offset target
        offsetTarget = Nothing
        Dim elevationTarget As SlopeElevationTarget 'slope or elevation target
        elevationTarget = Nothing
```

### Changes to CalcAlignmentOffsetToThisAlignment()

The `CalcAlignmentOffsetToThisAlignment()` utility method now calculate the offset from this alignment to the offset target. This method no longer returns the station value; it now returns the XY coordinate of the offset target at the point perpendicular to the alignment’s station.

You can also now use the `SlopeElevationTarget.GetElevation` method to get an elevation on an elevation target directly, instead of using `CalcAlignmentOffsetToThisAlignment()`. Here’s an example from the BasicLaneTransition.vb sample in the [Sample VB.NET Subassembly](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-03ADCEE6-5B64-4BD2-96A2-79A9EC16F73D.htm) section below:

```
                'get elevation on elevationTarget
                Try
                    dOffsetElev = elevationTarget.GetElevation(oCurrentAlignmentId, _
                       corridorState.CurrentStation, Utilities.GetSide(vSide))
                Catch
                    Utilities.RecordWarning(corridorState, _
                       CorridorError.LogicalNameNotFound, _
                       "TargetHA", "BasicLaneTransition")
                    dOffsetElev = corridorState.CurrentElevation + vWidth * vSlope
                End Try
```
