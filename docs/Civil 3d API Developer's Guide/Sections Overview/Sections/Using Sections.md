# Using Sections

Each sample line contains a collection of sections that were based on that sample line. Each section is represented by object of type `Section` and contains methods for retrieving statistics of the surface along the section.

Note that there is a naming ambiguity between `Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.Section` and `Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Section`. You can resolve this by fully qualifying the class name in your code, or disambiguate the reference with a using alias statement such as:

```
using Section = Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.Section;
```

In this example, we get the first `SampleLineGroup` for an `Alignment`, iterate the `SampleLines` in the `SampleLineGroup`, and then iterate each `Section` on SampleLine. We print out elevation information for the `Section`, and set the update mode.

```
// Use Centerline (1)
Alignment alignment = null;
foreach (ObjectId alignmentId in _civildoc.GetAlignmentIds())
{
    Alignment a = ts.GetObject(alignmentId, OpenMode.ForRead) as Alignment;
    if (a.Name == "Centerline (1)") { alignment = a; break; }
}
// Get the first sample line group, SLG-1:
SampleLineGroup sampleLineGroup = ts.GetObject(alignment.GetSampleLineGroupIds()[0], OpenMode.ForRead) as SampleLineGroup;
foreach (ObjectId sampleLineId in sampleLineGroup.GetSampleLineIds())
{
    SampleLine sampleLine = ts.GetObject(sampleLineId, OpenMode.ForRead) as SampleLine;
                    
    foreach ( ObjectId sectionId in sampleLine.GetSectionIds()){
        Section section = ts.GetObject(sectionId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as Section;
        _editor.WriteMessage("Section {0} elevation max: {1} min: {2}\n", section.Name, section.MaximumElevation, section.MinmumElevation);
        // set the section update mode:
        section.UpdateMode = SectionUpdateType.Dynamic;
    }
}
```
