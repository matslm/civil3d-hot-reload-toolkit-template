# Sections

Sections represent terrain elevations that cut across surfaces, including corridor surfaces, pipe networks, and grading, which are associated with a specified sample line group. Sections are "sampled" from a source (a surface or corridor shape). In the .NET API the sources for sections are exposed by the `SectionSource` object. A `SampleLineGroup` contains a collection of `SectionSources`, which can be accessed by the `SampleLineGroup.GetSectionSources()` method.
