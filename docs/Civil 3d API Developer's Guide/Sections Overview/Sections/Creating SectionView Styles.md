# Creating SectionView Styles

The `SectionViewStyle` object governs all aspects of how the graph axes, text, and titles are drawn. Within `SectionViewStyle` are settings dealing with the top, bottom, left, center vertical, and right axes, and with the graph as a whole. All section view styles are stored in the `CivilDocument.Styles.SectionViewStyles` collection.

Note that there is a naming ambiguity between `Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.Styles.SecitonViewStyle` and `Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.SectionViewStyle`. You can resolve this by fully qualifying the class name in your code, or disambiguiate the reference with a using alias statement such as:

```
using SectionViewStyle = Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices.Styles.SectionViewStyle;
```

New styles are created with the `Add()` method with the name of the new style. This style is only used in the plan view direction, and component display settings are accessed with the `SectionViewStyle.GetDisplayStylePlan()`. This method takes a `SectionViewDisplayStyleType` enum that specifies the component to get. Other style settings are accessed via properties for the `SectionViewStyle` object, such as `BottomAxis` and `GraphStyle.`

In this example, a new `SectionViewStyle` is created, and the Graph Title display component line type is set to "DOT":

```
ObjectId sectionViewStyleId = _civildoc.Styles.SectionViewStyles.Add("New SectionView Style");
SectionViewStyle sectionViewStyle = ts.GetObject(sectionViewStyleId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as SectionViewStyle;
sectionViewStyle.GetDisplayStylePlan(SectionViewDisplayStyleType.GraphTitle).Linetype = "DOT";
```

The title of the graph is controlled by the `SectionViewStyle.GraphStyle.TitleStyle` property, an object of type `GraphTitleStyle`. The title style object can adjust the position, style, and border of the title. The text of the title can include any of the following property fields:

|  |
| --- |
| <[Section View Description(CP)]> |
| <[Section View Name(CP)]> |
| <[Parent Alignment(CP)]> |
| <[Section View Station(Uft|FS|P3|RN|Sn|OF|AP|B2|TP|EN|W0|DZY)]> |
| <[Section View Datum Value(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Section View Width(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Left Width(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Right Width(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Drawing Scale(P3|RN|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Graph View Vertical Scale(P3|RN|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Graph View Vertical Exageration(P3|RN|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Sample Line Name(CP)]> |
| <[Sample Line Group(CP)]> |
| <[Sample Line Number(Sn)]> |

All axis styles are based on the `AxisStyle` class. The axis style object controls the display style of the axis itself, tick marks and text placed along the axis, and a text annotation describing the purpose of the axis. The annotation text, location, and size is set through the `AxisStyle.TitleStyle` property, an object of type `AxisTitleStyle`. The annotation text can use any of the following property fields:

|  |
| --- |
| **Valid property fields for AeccAxisTitleStyle.Text** | **Axes** |
| <[Section View Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> | top, bottom |
| <[Section View Width(Uft|P2|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | top, bottom |
| <[Left Width(Uft|P2|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | top, bottom |
| <[Right Width(Uft|P2|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | top, bottom |
| <[Elevation Range(Uft|P2|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | left, right, center |
| <[Minimum Elevation(Uft|P2|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | left, right, center |
| <[Maximum Elevation(Uft|P2|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | left, right, center |

Within each axis style are properties for specifying the tick marks placed along the axis. Both major tick marks and minor tick marks are represented by objects of type `AxisTickStyle` manages the location, size, and visual style of tick marks through its `Interval`, and `Size` properties.

Note: While most style properties use drawing units, the Interval property uses surface units.

The `AxisTickStyle` object also sets what text is displayed at each tick, including any of the following property fields:

|  |
| --- |
| <[Section View Point Offset Side(CP)]> |
| <[Section View Point Offset(Uft|P3|RN|Sn|OF|AP)]> |
| <[Graph View Abscissa Value(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
