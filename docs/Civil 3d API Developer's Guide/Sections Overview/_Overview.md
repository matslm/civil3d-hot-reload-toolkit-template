# Sections Overview

The .NET API exposes classes and methods to access and create Sample Lines, Sections, and Section Views. Sample Lines are encapsulated by the `SampleLine` object, and related `SampleLine` objects are organized in a `SampleLineGroup` collection. `SampleLineGroup` objects are associated with `Alignments.`

Sections are the surfaces, corridor models, or pipe networks that intersect the vertical plane defined by a sample line. In the .NET API, these surfaces are represented by `SectionSource` objects. `SectionSource` objects are held in a `SampleLineGroup`'s `SectionSourceCollection.`

Section Views are encapsulated by the `SectionView` object. A `SectionView` is associated with (and created from) a related `SampleLine`. The features shown in a section view are determined by the `Sections` sampled.
