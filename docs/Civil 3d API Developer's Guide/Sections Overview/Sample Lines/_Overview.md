# Sample Lines

`SampleLine` objects are held in an Alignment's `SampleLineGroup` collection, which is obtained with the `Alignment.GetSampleLineGroupIds()` method. The collection of `SampleLine` objects in a `SampleLineGroup` is obtained with the `SampleLineGroup.GetSamleLineIds()` method. This example illustrates how to access both these collections, by listing all the `SampleLineGroups` and `SampleLines` for the first Alignment in a drawing:

```
ObjectId alignmentId = _civildoc.GetAlignmentIds()[0];
Alignment alignment = ts.GetObject(alignmentId, OpenMode.ForRead) as Alignment;

foreach (ObjectId oid in alignment.GetSampleLineGroupIds())
{
    SampleLineGroup sampleLineGroup = ts.GetObject(oid, OpenMode.ForRead) as SampleLineGroup;
    _editor.WriteMessage("Sample Line Group: {0}\n", sampleLineGroup.Name);
    foreach (ObjectId sampleLineId in sampleLineGroup.GetSampleLineIds())
    {
        SampleLine sampleline = ts.GetObject(sampleLineId, OpenMode.ForRead) as SampleLine;
        _editor.WriteMessage("Sample Line: {0}\n", sampleline.Name);
    }

}
```

You can create new `SampleLines` using the `SampleLine.Create()` static method, which takes the name of the new `SampleLine`, the `ObjectId` of the `SampleLineGroup` to add the `SampleLine` to, and either a station number (the RawStation number, as `Double`) or a `Point2dCollection` containing points defining the vertex of the new `SampleLine.`

In this example, the user is prompted to select an Alignment, and `SampleLines` are added for each major station on the Alignment.

```
// prompt user for Alignment
ObjectId alignmentId = promptForEntity("Select an Alignment to add sample lines to:", typeof(Alignment));
Alignment alignment = ts.GetObject(alignmentId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as Alignment;
ObjectId sampleLineGroupId = SampleLineGroup.Create("New Group", alignmentId);
SampleLineGroup sampleLineGroup = ts.GetObject(sampleLineGroupId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as SampleLineGroup;

Station[] majorStations = alignment.GetStationSet(StationTypes.Major);

foreach (Station station in majorStations)
{
    ObjectId sampleLineId = SampleLine.Create("SampleLine" + station.RawStation, sampleLineGroupId, station.RawStation);
    SampleLine sampleLine = ts.GetObject(sampleLineId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as SampleLine;
    sampleLine.StyleName = "Standard";
}
```
