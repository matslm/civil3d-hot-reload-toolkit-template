# Getting Survey Network Drawing Objects

You can get and manipulate the AutoCAD drawing objects that make up a survey network from the Autodesk Civil 3D user interface. The drawing objects are represented by the `AeccSurveyNetworkEntity` object. For example, this code prompts the user to select the survey network, tests whether it is the survey network object, and then prints some information about it:

```
Dim objPart As AeccSurveyNetworkEntity
Dim objEnt As AcadObject
Dim objAcadEnt As AcadEntity
Dim varPick As Variant
ThisDrawing.Utility.GetEntity objEnt, varPick, "Select the Survey Network"
If TypeOf objEnt Is AeccSurveyNetworkEntity Then
   Set objPart = objEnt
   Debug.Print objPart.Name, TypeName(objPart)
ElseIf TypeOf objEnt Is AcadEntity Then
   Set objAcadEnt = objEnt
   Debug.Print objAcadEnt.Name, TypeName(objAcadEnt)
End If
```
