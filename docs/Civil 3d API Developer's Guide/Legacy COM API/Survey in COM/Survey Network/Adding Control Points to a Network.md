# Adding Control Points to a Network

Control points are the “known” or “fixed” locations that other survey points are based from. The collection of control points in a network is held in the `AeccSurveyNetwork.ControlPoints` property. New control points can be added to the network through the collection’s `Create` method. `Create` adds a new point with the specified features to the `AeccSurveyControlPoints` collection and returns a reference to the newly created `AeccSurveyControlPoint` object.

```
' Get collection of all control points.
Dim oControlPoints As AeccSurveyControlPoints
Set oControlPoints = oSurveyNetwork.ControlPoints
 
' Create a control point with an id number of 3001 at 
' the location 5000.0m, 5000.0m, elevation 100.0m.
Dim oControlPoint As AeccSurveyControlPoint
Set oControlPoint = oControlPoints.Create( _
  3001, _
  "ControlPoint_01", _
  "Description of control point", _
  5000#, _
  5000#, _
  100#)
```
