# Adding Non-control Points to a Network

A survey network also contains a collection of non-control points, which represent points within a survey network whose location is determined by observation, but are not connected to other survey observations and remain unaffected by a network analysis. These non-control points are represented by objects of type `AeccNonControlPoint`, and are defined by an easting, northing, and an optional elevation. The collection of all non-control points in a survey network are held in the `AeccSurveyNetwork.NonControlPoints` property.

```
' Create a non-control point with an id number of 3006 at 
' the location 4950.0, 5000.0, elevation 100.0.
Dim oNonControlPt As AeccSurveyNonControlPoint
Set oNonControlPt = oSurveyNetwork.NonControlPoints.Create( _
  3006, 
  "NonControlPoint_01",
  "Description of non-control point",
  4950#,
  5000#, 
  100#)
```

A non-control point may be promoted to a control point if you reference the point as a control point when creating a traverse, or reference the point as a setup to make observations to other points that may affect locations during an analysis.
