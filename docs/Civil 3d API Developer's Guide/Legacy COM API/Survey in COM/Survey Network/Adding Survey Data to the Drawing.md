# Adding Survey Data to the Drawing

Adding elements or modifying information in a survey network object changes the survey database but does not automatically change the drawing. After you are done adding points, directions, and other elements that have a graphical element, call the `AeccSurveyNetwork.AddToDrawing` method to create AutoCAD elements that correspond to the survey network data. This is equivalent to the Autodesk Civil 3D command “Insert Into Drawing”.

```
oSurveyNetwork.AddToDrawing
```
