# Creating a Survey Project

The survey database is the high-level construct that contains collections of networks and figures, and provides access to survey points. Throughout the API, survey databases are called “projects.” The collection of all projects in a document are held in the `AeccSurveyDocument.Projects` property. Once created, a project cannot be removed from this collection using API methods. The only way to remove a survey project is to delete the Project folder and refresh the collection. When a new project is created, a unique GUID identifying the project is generated.

This sample creates a new survey project with the name “Proj01”:

```
Dim oSurveyProject As AeccSurveyProject
Set oSurveyProject = oSurveyDocument.Projects.Create("Proj01")
 
' Print the next available survey point Id available.
Debug.Print "Next available Id:"; _
  oSurveyProject.GetNextWritablePointNumber()
```
