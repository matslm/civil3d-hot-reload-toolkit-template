# Adjusting Survey Project Settings

A survey project has a group of properties accessed through the survey project settings object. Survey project settings define what measurement units are used, what angle types are used, and the precision of each measurement. It records what kinds of adjustments are made to observations, and the types and accuracy of traverse analyses and angle balancing. It also has methods for converting between metric units and the units of the ambient settings, and between easting and northing and longitude and latitude. The project settings object is retrieved through the `AeccSurveyProject.GetProjectSettings` method, which returns an `AeccSurveyProjectSettings` object. To apply any changes made to the project settings, pass the modified `AeccSurveyProjectSettings` object to the `AeccSurveyProject.UpdateProjectSettings` method.

```
Dim oProjectSettings As AeccSurveyProjectSettings
Set oProjectSettings = oSurveyProject.GetProjectSettings()
 
' Modify and examine the current settings.
With oProjectSettings
   .AngleType = aeccSurveyAngleTypeAzimuth
   Debug.Print "Sea level correction? :"; .SeaLevelCorrection
End With
 
' Save the changes to the project settings object.
oSurveyProject.UpdateProjectSettings oProjectSettings
```
