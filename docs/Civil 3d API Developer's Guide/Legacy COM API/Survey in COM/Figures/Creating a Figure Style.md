# Creating a Figure Style

A figure style controls the visual appearance of figures. The `AeccSurveyFigureStyle` object has `AeccDisplayStyle` properties for controlling the color, line type, and visibility of lines and of markers at the figure endpoints, the figure midpoint, at line vertices. The types of markers used are controlled by separate `AeccMarkerStyle` properties for the start, mid, and end points of the figure, and for all vertexes. Markers can also be drawn at a normal alignment to the orientation of the figure by setting the `IsAlignAdditionalMarkersWithFigure`, `IsAlignMidPointMarkersWithFigure`, `IsAlignStartAndEndPointMarkersWithFigure`, and `IsAlignVertexMarkersWithFigure` properties to `True` for the appropriate type of marker.

Additional markers can also be placed along the figure. The nature of these additional markers is set by the `AeccSurveyFigureStyle.AdditionalMarkersPlacementMethod` property. If the placement method is set for interval placement, then a new marker is placed every *n* units apart where *n* is the value of the `AeccSurveyFigureStyle.AdditionalMarkersInterval` property. If the placement method is set for divided placement, then the figure is divided into *n* parts of equal length where *n* is the value of the `AeccSurveyFigureStyle.AdditionalMarkersDivideFigureBy` property. A marker is placed at each part, including the figure start and end points. If the placement method is set for continuous, then the markers are placed exactly one marker’s width apart along the length of the figure.

You can determine the style of figure drawing by examining the `FigureDisplayMode` property. There are three ways a figure can be visualized: using figure elevations, flattening the figure to a single elevation, or exaggerating figure elevations. If the figure is flattened to a single elevation, the elevation can be read from the `FlattenFigureElevation` property. If the figure elevations are exaggerated when displayed, the amount of exaggerations is held in the read-only `FigureElevationScaleFactor` property.

All figure styles are stored in the `AeccSurveyDocument.FigureStyle` collection. The figure object’s `AeccSurveyFigure.Style` property takes the string name of the style to use.

This sample creates a new figure style object and adjusts some of the style settings:

```
Dim oFigureStyles As AeccSurveyFigureStyles
Dim oFigureStyle As AeccSurveyFigureStyle
Set oFigureStyles = oSurveyDocument.FigureStyles
Set oFigureStyle = oFigureStyles.Add(sStylename)
 
' Set the style so that additional markers are visible,
' blue, and drawn every 20 units along the figure.
With oFigureStyle
    .AdditionalMarkersDisplayStylePlan.Visible = True
    .AdditionalMarkersDisplayStylePlan.Color = 150 ' blue
    .AdditionalMarkersPlacementMethod = _
      aeccSurveyAdditionalMarkerPlacementMethodAtInterval
    .AdditionalMarkersInterval = 20
End With
 
' Assign the style to a figure.
oFigure.Style = oFigureStyle.Name
```
