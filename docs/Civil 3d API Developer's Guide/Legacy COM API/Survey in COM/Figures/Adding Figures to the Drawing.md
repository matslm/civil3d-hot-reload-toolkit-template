# Adding Figures to the Drawing

Adding lines and arcs to a figure changes the survey database but does not automatically change the drawing. After you are done adding elements to the figure, call the `AeccSurveyFigure.AddToDrawing` method to create AutoCAD elements that correspond to the figure. This is equivalent to the Autodesk Civil 3D command “Insert Into Drawing”.
