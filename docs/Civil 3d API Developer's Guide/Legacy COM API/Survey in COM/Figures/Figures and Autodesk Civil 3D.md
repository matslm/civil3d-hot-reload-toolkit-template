# Figures and Autodesk Civil 3D

A figure can influence Autodesk Civil 3D objects such as parcels and TIN surfaces. If the `AeccSurveyFigure.IsLotLine` property is set to `True`, then parcel segments are created for each figure line and arc when the figure is added to the drawing. If any set of parcel segments creates closed figures, then a parcel is formed. You can assign the parcel segments to a particular site by setting the `AeccSurveyFigure.Site` property - otherwise, a new site named “Survey Site” is created automatically. The figure still remains in the survey database, and deleting the figure removes all associated parcel segments from the drawing.

A figure can also form a breakline that defines how surfaces are triangulated. This is accomplished by setting the `AeccSurveyFigure.IsBreakline` property to `True`
