# Adding Arcs to a Figure

Each arc added to a figure is drawn from the endpoint of the previous line or arc. `AddArc` adds a segment of a circle to the figure to the specified point location. The shape of the arc is defined by the `Radius`, `Bulge`, and `CenterX` and `CenterY` parameters. The `Bulge` parameter defines what fraction of a circle the arc comprises. If the `Radius` parameter is zero or negative the arc is curved in the clockwise direction, otherwise the arc is curved in the counter-clockwise direction. An optional parameter can specify a survey point to reference so that whenever it changes the arc endpoint will change as well.

```
' Create a clockwise arc comprising of roughly half a circle 
' that ends at survey point 3001.
oFigure.AddArc 10, 1.7, 0, 0, oPoint1.Easting, _
  oPoint1.Northing, , 3001
```
