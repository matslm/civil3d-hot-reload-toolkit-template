# Extracting Contours from a TIN Surface

You can extract a contour (or contours) from a surface in a given elevation range as AutoCAD entities. This example extracts the contours between 90 and 95, and prints out the entity type for each one.

Note:

The contours that you wish to extract must be visible in the drawing for this example to work.

```
...
Dim z As Double
Dim objSurf As AeccSurface
Set objSurf = g_oAeccDoc.Surfaces(0)
Dim varObjects As Variant
Dim objEnt As AcadEntity
Dim iCtr As Integer, iLow As Integer, iHigh As Integer
varObjects = objSurf.ExtractContour(aeccDisplayOrientationPlan, aeccSFMajorContours, 90, 95)
iLow = LBound(varObjects)
iHigh = UBound(varObjects)
For iCtr = iLow To iHigh
   Set objEnt = varObjects(iCtr)
   Debug.Print TypeName(objEnt)
Next iCtr
```
