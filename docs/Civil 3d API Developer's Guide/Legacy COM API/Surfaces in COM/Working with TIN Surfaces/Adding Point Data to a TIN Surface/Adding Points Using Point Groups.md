# Adding Points Using Point Groups

You can manually add points to a TIN surface by adding point groups to the `AeccTinSurface.PointGroups` collection.

```
' Make a surface consisting of 30 random points. To do
' this, first add 30 points to the document's collection
' of points, then make a point group from those points. 
' Finally, add that point group to the surface.
Dim i As Integer
For i = 0 To 29
    Dim pt(0 To 2) As Double
    pt(0) = Int(5000 * Rnd())
    pt(1) = Int(5000 * Rnd())
    pt(2) = Int(200 * Rnd())
    Dim oPoint As AeccPoint
    Set oPoint = oAeccDocument.Points.Add(pt)
    oPoint.Name = "Point" & CStr(i)
Next i
 
Dim oPtGroup As AeccPointGroup
Set oPtGroup = oAeccDocument.PointtGroups.Add("Random group")
' Add all points with a name beginning with "Point"
oPtGroup.QueryBuilder.IncludeNames = "point*"
' Add the point group to the surface.
oTinSurface.PointGroups.Add oPtGroup
oTinSurface.Update
```

You can also add points to a surface by adding contour lines. See [Adding Contours to a TIN Surface](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-75295A16-B6C0-4C11-8A35-7824DD28489B.htm).

All points that make up a surface can be retrieved from the read-only `AeccTinSurface.Points` property, which is an array of locations.

```
' Print the location (easting, northing, and elevation)
' of the 1000th point.
Dim vLocation as Variant
vLocation = oTinSurface.Points(1000)
 
' Now vLocation contains a 3 element array of doubles.
Debug.Print "Easting:"; vLocation(0)
Debug.Print "Northing:"; vLocation(1)
Debug.Print "Elevation:"; vLocation(2)
```
