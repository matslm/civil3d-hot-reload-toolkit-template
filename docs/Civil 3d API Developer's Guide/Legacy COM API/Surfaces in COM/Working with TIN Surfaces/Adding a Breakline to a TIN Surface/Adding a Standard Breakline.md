# Adding a Standard Breakline

A standard breakline consists of an array of 3D lines or polylines. Each line endpoint becomes a point in the surface and surface triangles around the breakline are redone. If the polyline contains curves, then the curve is tessellated based on the mid-ordinate distance parameter.

```
' Create the polyline basis for the breakline.
Dim o3DPoly as Acad3DPolyline
Dim dPoints(0 To 8) As Double
dPoints(0) = 1200: dPoints(1) = 1200: dPoints(2) = 150
dPoints(3) = 2000: dPoints(4) = 3000: dPoints(5) = 120
dPoints(6) = 3000: dPoints(7) = 2000: dPoints(8) = 100
Set o3DPoly = oAeccDocument.Database.ModelSpace _ 
  .Add3DPoly(dPoints)
o3DPoly.Closed = False
Dim oBreakline As AeccSurfaceBreakline
Dim vBLines As Variant
' This has to be an array, even if we only have one entity.
Dim oEntityArray(0) As AcadEntity
Set oEntityArray(0) = oAeccDocument.Database.ModelSpace _
  .Add3DPoly(dPoints)
Set oBreakline = oTinSurface.Breaklines.AddStandardBreakline _
  (oEntityArray, "Sample Standard Break", 1#)
```
