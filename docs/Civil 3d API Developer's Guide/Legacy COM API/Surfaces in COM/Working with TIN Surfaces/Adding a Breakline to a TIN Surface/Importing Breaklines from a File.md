# Importing Breaklines from a File

You can import breaklines from a file in .FLT format, using `AeccSurfaceBreaklines.AddBreaklineFromFile()`. When you import the file, you need to specify whether to maintain the file link, or break the link:

* `aeccBreaklineFileMaintainLink`: Reads the breaklines from the FLT file when they are added and when the surface is rebuilt.
* `aeccBreaklineFileBreakLink`: All breaklines in the FLT file are copied into the surface as Add Breakline operations.

For more information about these options, see [To Import Breaklines from a File](https://beehive.autodesk.com/community/service/rest/cloudhelp/resource/cloudhelpchannel/guidcrossbook/?v=2026&p=CIV3D&l=ENU&accessmode=live&guid=GUID-BD2BC12A-465D-4F7F-A678-4A1569804524).

This sample shows how to import breaklines from a file named eg1.flt, and to get the first newly created breakline:

```
Dim oBrkLine As AeccSurfaceBreakline 
Set oBrkLine = brkLines.AddBreaklineFromFile("New Breakline", "C:\eg1.flt", 10#, aeccBreaklineFileBreakLink)(0)
```
