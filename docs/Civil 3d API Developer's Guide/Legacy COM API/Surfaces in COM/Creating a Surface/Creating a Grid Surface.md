# Creating a Grid Surface

## Creating a Surface From a DEM File

A grid surface can be generated from a DEM file using the `AeccSurfaces.ImportDEM` method.

Note:

The conversion process between the raster information and a surface can be slow. Be sure to indicate this to the user.

```
Dim oGridSurface As AeccGridSurface
Dim sFileName As String
sFileName = "C:\My Documents\file.dem"
oGridSurface = oAeccDocument.Surfaces.ImportDEM(sFileName)
```

## Creating a Surface From AddGridSurface

A blank grid surface can be created using the `AeccSurfaces.AddGridSurface` method. Before you can use this method you need to prepare an object of type `AeccGridCreationData`, which describes the nature of the surface to be created. It is important to specify every property of the `AeccGridCreationData` object to avoid errors. Units for `XSpacing`, `YSpacing` and `Orientation` are specified in the ambient settings.

```
Dim oGridSurface As AeccGridSurface
Dim oGridCreationData As New AeccGridCreationData
 
oGridData.Name = "Sample Grid Surface"
oGridData.Description = "Grid Surface"
oGridData.BaseLayer = oAeccDocument.Layers.Item(0).Name
oGridData.Layer = oAeccDocument.Layers.Item(0).Name
oGridData.Orientation = 0#
oGridData.XSpacing = 100#
oGridData.YSpacing = 100#
oGridData.Style = oAeccDocument.SurfaceStyles.Item(0).Name
Set oGridSurface = oAeccDocument.Surfaces _
  .AddGridSurface(oGridData)
```
