# Creating a Surface From a LandXML File

A surface saved as a LandXML file can be loaded using the `AeccSurfaces.ImportXML` method. The file also describes the kind of surface to be created, so you do not need to know beforehand. After the surface has been loaded, you can examine the `AeccSurface.Type` property and assign the generic surface reference to a more specific type.

```
Dim oSurface As AeccSurface
Dim sFileName As String
sFileName = "C:\My Documents\EG.xml"
Set oSurface = oAeccDocument.Surfaces.ImportXML(sFileName)
 
Dim oTinSurface as AeccTinSurface
If (oSurface.Type = aecckTinSurface) Then
    Set oTinSurface = oSurface
End If
```
