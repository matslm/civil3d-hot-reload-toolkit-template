# Creating a Volume Surface

A volume surface represents the mathematical difference between two TIN surfaces or between two grid surfaces in the document. It is created using the `AeccSurfaces.AddTinVolumeSurface` or `AeccSurfaces.AddGridVolumeSurface` methods. Each of these methods require the creation of objects (`AeccGridVolumeCreationData` or `AeccTinVolumeCreationData`) that describe the new volume surface. It is important to specify every property of these objects to avoid errors. Units for `XSpacing`, `YSpacing` and `Orientation` are specified in the ambient settings.

This sample demonstrates the creation of a TIN volume surface from two existing surfaces, `oTinSurfaceL` and `oTinSurfaceH`:

```
' Get the names of the layer and style to be used.
Dim sLayerName as String
sLayerName = g_oAeccDocument.Layers.Item(0).Name
Dim sStyleName as String
sStyleName = oAeccDocument.SurfaceStyles.Item(0).Name
 
' Create a AeccTinVolumeCreationData object and set all its
' properties.
Dim oTinVolumeCreationData As New AeccTinVolumeCreationData
oTinVolumeCreationData.Name = "VS"
oTinVolumeCreationData.BaseLayer = sLayerName
oTinVolumeCreationData.Layer = sLayerName
Set oTinVolumeCreationData.BaseSurface = oTinSurfaceL
Set oTinVolumeCreationData.ComparisonSurface = oTinSurfaceH
oTinVolumeCreationData.Style = 
oTinVolumeCreationData.Description = "Volume Surface"
 
' Create a new TIN volume surface.
Dim oTinVolumeSurface As AeccTinVolumeSurface
Set oTinVolumeSurface = oAeccDocument.Surfaces _
  .AddTinVolumeSurface(oTinVolumeCreationData)
```
