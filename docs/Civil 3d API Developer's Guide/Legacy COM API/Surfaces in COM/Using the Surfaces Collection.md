# Using the Surfaces Collection

All surfaces in a drawing are located in the `AeccDocument.Surfaces` collection. Each surface in the collection can be accessed through the `AeccSurfaces.Item` method, which takes either an integer index or the string name of the surface. The `AeccSurfaces.Item` method returns a generic reference of type `AeccSurface`, so you need to check the `AeccSurface.Type` property to actually determine what kind of surface it is.

This sample examines each surface in the drawing and reports what kind of surface it is:

```
Dim oSurface As AeccSurface
Dim i As Integer
 
For i = 0 To oAeccDocument.Surfaces.Count - 1
    Set oSurface = oAeccDocument.Surfaces.Item(i)
    Select Case (oSurface.Type)
        Case aecckGridSurface:
            Dim oGridSurface As AeccGridSurface
            Set oGridSurface = oSurface
            Debug.Print oGridSurface.Name & ": Grid"
        Case aecckTinSurface:
            Dim oTinSurface As AeccTinSurface
            Set oTinSurface = oSurface
            Debug.Print oTinSurface.Name & ": TIN"
        Case aecckGridVolumeSurface:
            Dim oGridVolume As AeccGridVolumeSurface
            Set oGridVolume = oSurface
            Debug.Print oGridVolume.Name & ": Grid Volume"
        Case aecckTinVolumeSurface:
            Dim oTinVolume As AeccTinVolumeSurface
            Set oTinVolume = oSurface
            Debug.Print oTinVolume.Name & ": TIN Valume"
    End Select
Next i
```
