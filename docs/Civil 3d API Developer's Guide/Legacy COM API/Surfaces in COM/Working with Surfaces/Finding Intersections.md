# Finding Intersections

When working with surfaces, it can be useful to determine where a vector intersects with a surface, which you can do with the surface’s `IntersectPointWithSurface()` method. For example, you can determine if the top of a structure is visible from a point on the surface, or whether one point on the surface is visible from another point. This example tests whether a vector starting at (20424.7541, 20518.0409, 100) pointing in direction (0.6, 0.4, -0.5) intersects with the first surface in the drawing, and if it does, it prints out the intersection location:

```
Dim objSurf As AeccSurface
Dim varStartPt As Variant, varDir As Variant, varIntPt As Variant
Dim darrStart(2) As Double
Dim darrDir(2) As Double
darrStart(0) = 20424.7541
darrStart(1) = 20518.0409
darrStart(2) = 100
darrDir(0) = 0.6
darrDir(1) = 0.4
darrDir(2) = -0.5
varStartPt = darrStart
varDir = darrDir
Set objSurf = g_oAeccDoc.Surfaces(0)
varIntPt = objSurf.IntersectPointWithSurface(varStartPt, varDir)
If UBound(varIntPt) = 2 Then
   Debug.Print varIntPt(0), varIntPt(1), varIntPt(2)
End If
```
