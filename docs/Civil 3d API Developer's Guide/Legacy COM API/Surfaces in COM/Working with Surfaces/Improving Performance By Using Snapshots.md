# Improving Performance By Using Snapshots

A surface is made up of all the operations that modified the surface’s triangles. If you rebuild the surface, re-performing all these operations can be slow. Snapshots can improve performance by recording all the triangles in a surface. Subsequent rebuilds start from the data of the snapshot, thus saving time by not performing complicated calculations that have already been done once. Surfaces have `CreateSnapshot`, `RebuildSnapshot`, and `RemoveSnapshot` methods. Both `CreateSnapshot` and `RebuildSnapshot` will overwrite an existing snapshot.

Tip:

`RebuildSnapshot` will cause an error if the snapshot does not exist. `CreateSnapshot` and `RebuildSnapshot` can also cause errors if the surface is out-of-date.
