# Adding Data Bands to a Profile View

Every profile view contains a collection of bands in its `AeccProfileView.BandSet` property, an object of type `AeccProfileViewBandSet`. When a profile view is first created, all band styles from the `AeccProfileViewBandStyleSet` parameter are added to this collection. Individual band styles can be added to a section view through the `AeccProfileViewBandSet` collection using its `Add` or `Insert` methods. Both of these methods take an `AeccProfileDataBandStyle` style, a parent alignment, and two `AeccProfile` objects, allowing comparison between profiles.

Tip:

If you only want to display information from a single profile in the band, pass the same profile object to both parameters.

The order of bands in the band set is also the order in which the bands are displayed. `AeccProfileViewBandSet.Add` places the new band at the bottom of the list while `AeccProfileViewBandSet.Insert` places the new band at the specified index.

Tip:

You can swap the location of two bands with the `AeccProfileViewBandSet.Swap` method.

This sample adds a data band to a profile view that describes the single profile “oProfile” based on the alignment “oAlignment”:

```
Dim oProfileViewBandSetItem As AeccProfileViewBandSetItem
Set oProfileViewBandSetItem = oProfileView.BandSet.Add( _
  oBandStyle, _
  oAlignment, _
  oProfile, _
  oProfile)
  
' Now oProfileView has another data band.
```
