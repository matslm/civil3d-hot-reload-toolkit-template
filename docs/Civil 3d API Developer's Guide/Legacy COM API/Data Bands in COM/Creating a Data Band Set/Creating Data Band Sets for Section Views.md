# Creating Data Band Sets for Section Views

Individual band styles can be grouped together into a set, which can then be assigned to a graph. Band sets for section graphs are objects of type `AeccSectionViewBandStyleSet`, and all such sets are stored in the `AeccDocument.SectionViewBandStyleSet` collection.

The following example demonstrates creating a section band style set and adding a band style to it:

```
Dim oSectionViewBandStyleSet As AeccSectionViewBandStyleSet
Set oSectionViewBandStyleSet = _
  oDocument.SectionViewBandStyleSets.Add("Section Band Set")
 
' Add a band style we have already created to the
' band set.
Call oSectionViewBandStyleSet.Add(oBandSectionDataStyle)
 
' Now we have a band set consisting of one band.
```

Data band sets are used when section views are first created. The following sample code is taken from the [Creating Section Views](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-62A68181-648C-4ABC-9DAB-AB36C721355D.htm) section of the [Sections](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2026/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-52FEAA8B-BE9C-4C3B-9D11-185E9818B684.htm) chapter, but this time a data band set is passed in the last parameter:

```
Set oSectionView=oSampleLines.Item(j).SectionViews.Add( _
   "Section View" & CStr(j), _
   "0", _
   dOriginPt, _
   oSectionViewStyle, _
   oSectionViewBandStyleSet)
```
