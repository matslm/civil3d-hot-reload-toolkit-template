# Pipe-Specific Ambient Settings

Ambient settings allow you to get and set the units and default property settings of pipe network objects as well as access the catalog of all pipe and structure parts held in the document. Ambient settings for a pipe document are held in the `AeccPipeDocument.Settings` property, an object of type `AeccPipeSettingsRoot`. `AeccPipeSettingsRoot` inherits all the properties of the `AeccSettingsRoot` class.

Among the properties of `AeccPipeSettingsRoot` are `InterferenceSettings`, `PipeSettings`, and `StructureSettings`. Each of these properties consist of an `AeccSettingsAmbient` object, which describes the default units of measurement for interference, pipe, and structure objects. The `AeccPipeSettingsRoot.PipeNetworkSettings` property contains the name of the default styles for pipe and structure objects as well as the default label placement, units, and naming conventions for pipe networks as a whole.

```
' Get the default set of pipe rules used in this document.
With oSettings.PipeNetworkSettings.RulesSettings
    Debug.Print "Using pipe rules:"; .PipeDefaultRules.Value
End With
 
' Set the default units used for pipes in this document.
With oSettings.PipeSettings.AmbientSettings
    .AngleSettings.Unit = aeccAngleUnitRadian
    .CoordinateSettings.Unit = aeccCoordinateUnitFoot
    .DistanceSettings.Unit = aeccCoordinateUnitFoot
End With
```

The `AeccPipeSettingsRoot` object also has a `PipeNetworkCommandsSettings`property, which contains properties that affect pipe network-related commands. Each sub-property contains an AmbientSettings property which describes the default units of measurement for interference, pipe, and structure objects, plus other properties specific to the command.
