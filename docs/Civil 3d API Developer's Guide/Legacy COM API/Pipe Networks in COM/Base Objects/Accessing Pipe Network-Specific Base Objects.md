# Accessing Pipe Network-Specific Base Objects

Applications that access pipe networks require special versions of the base objects representing the application and document. The `AeccPipeApplication` object is identical to the `AeccApplication` it is inherited from except that its `AeccPipeApplication.ActiveDocument` property returns an object of type `AeccPipeDocument` instead of `AeccDocument`. The `AeccPipeDocument` object contains collections of pipe network-related items, such as pipe networks, pipe styles, and interference checks. It also contains all of the methods and properties of `AeccDocument`.

When using pipe network root objects, be sure to reference the “Autodesk Civil Engineering Pipe 6.0 Object Library” (AeccXPipe.tlb) and “Autodesk Civil Engineering UI Pipe 6.0 Object Library” (AeccXUIPipe.tlb) libraries.

This sample demonstrates how to retrieve the pipe network root objects:

```
Dim oApp As AcadApplication
Set oApp = ThisDrawing.Application
Dim sAppName As String
sAppName = "AeccXUiPipe.AeccPipeApplication"
Dim oPipeApplication As AeccPipeApplication
Set oPipeApplication = oApp.GetInterfaceObject(sAppName)
 
' Get a reference to the currently active document.
Dim oPipeDocument As AeccPipeDocument
Set oPipeDocument = oPipeApplication.ActiveDocument
```
