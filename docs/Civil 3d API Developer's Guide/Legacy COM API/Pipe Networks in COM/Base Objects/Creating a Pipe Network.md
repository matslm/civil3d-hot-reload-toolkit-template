# Creating a Pipe Network

A pipe network is a set of interconnected or related parts. The collection of all pipe networks is held in the `AeccPipeDocument.PipeNetworks` property. A pipe network, an object of type `AeccPipeNetwork`, contains the collection of pipes and the collection of structures which make up the network. `AeccPipeNetwork` also contains the method `AeccPipeNetwork.FindShortestNetworkPath` for determining the path between two network parts.

The `AeccPipeNetwork.ReferenceAlignment` is used by pipe and structure label properties. For example, you can create a label that shows the station and offset from the alignment. The `AeccPipeNetwork.ReferenceSurface` is used primarily for Pipe Rules. For example, you can have a rule that places the structure rim at a specified elevation from the surface. Labels may also refer to the `ReferenceSurface` property.

```
' Get the collection of all networks.
Dim oPipeNetworks as AeccPipeNetworks
Set oPipeNetworks = oPipeDocument.PipeNetworks
 
' Create a new pipe network
Set oPipeNetwork = oPipeNetworks.Add("Network Name")
```
