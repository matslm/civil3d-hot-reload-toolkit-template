# Creating Structures

Structures represent physical objects such as manholes, catch basins, and headwalls. Logically, structures are used as connections between pipes at pipe endpoints. In cases where two pipes connect directly, an `AeccStructure` object not representing any physical object is still created to serve as the joint. Any number of pipes can connect with a structure. Structures are represented by objects of type `AeccStructure`, which are created by using the `Add` method of the `Surfaces` collection of `AeccPipeNetwork`.

This sample uses the first structure family and size filter it can find in the part list and creates a new structure based on that part type.

```
Dim oStructure as AeccStructure
Dim oSettings As AeccPipeSettingsRoot
Dim oPartLists As AeccPartLists
Dim oPartList As AeccPartList
Dim sStructureGuid As String
Dim oStructureFilter As AeccPartSizeFilter
 
' Go through the list of part types and select the first
' structure found.
Set oSettings = oPipeDocument.Settings
' Get all the parts list in the drawing.
Set oPartLists = oSettings.PartLists
' Get the first part list found.
Set oPartList = oPartLists.Item(0)
For Each oPartFamily In oPartList
   ' Look for a structure family that is not named
   ' "Null Structure".
   If (oPartFamily.Domain = aeccDomStructure) And _
     (oPartFamily.Name = "Null Structure") Then
      sStructureGuid = oPartFamily.guid
      ' Get the first size filter list from the family.
      Set oStructureFilter = oPartFamily.SizeFilters.Item(0)
      Exit For
   End If
Next
 
Dim dPoint(0 To 2) As Double
dPoint(0) = 100: dPoint(1) = 100 
 
' Assuming a valid AeccNetwork object "oNetwork".
Set oStructure = oNetwork.Structures.Add( _
  sStructureGuid, _
  oStructureFilter, _
  dPoint, _
  5.2333) ' 305 degrees in radians
```
