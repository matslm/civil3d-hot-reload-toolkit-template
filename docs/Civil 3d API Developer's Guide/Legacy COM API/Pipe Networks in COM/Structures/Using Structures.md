# Using Structures

To make the new structure a meaningful part of a pipe network, it must be connected to pipes in the network using the `AeccStructure.ConnectToPipe` method or pipes must be connected to it using the `AeccPipe.ConnectToStructure` method. After a structure has been connected to a network, you can determine the pipes connected to it by using the `Connections` property, which is a read-only collection of network parts. There are also methods and properties for setting and determining all types of physical measurements for the structure and for accessing collections of user-defined properties for custom descriptions of the structure.

```
' Given a pipe and a structure, join the second endpoint
' of the pipe to the structure.
oStructure.ConnectToPipe oPipeNew, aeccPipeEnd
 
' Determine flow directions from all pipes connected
' to a structure.
Dim i As Integer
For i = 0 To oStructure.ConnectedPipesCount - 1
   If (oStructure.IsConnectedPipeFlowingIn(i) = True) Then
      Debug.Print "Pipe "; i; " flows into structure"
   Else
      Debug.Print "Pipe "; i; " does not flow into structure"
   End If
Next i
```
