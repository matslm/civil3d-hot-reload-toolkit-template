# Creating Structure Styles

A structure style controls the visual appearance of structures in a document. All structure style objects are stored in the `AeccPipeDocument.StructureStyles` collection. Structure styles have four methods for controlling general appearance attributes and three properties for controlling display attributes that are specific to structures. The methods `DisplayStylePlan|Profile|Section|Model` and `HatchStylePlan|Profile|Section` all take a parameter describing the feature being modified and return a reference to the `AeccDisplayStyle` or `AeccHatchDisplayStyle` object controlling common display attributes such as line styles and color. The properties `PlanOption`, `ProfileOption`, and `ModelOption` set the display size of the structure and whether the structure is shown as a model of the physical object or only symbolically. A structure object is given a style by assigning the `AeccStructure.Style` property to a `AeccStructureStyle` object.

This sample creates a new structure style object, sets some of its properties, and assigns it to a structure object:

```
' Create a new structure style object.
Dim oStructureStyle As AeccStructureStyle
Set oStructureStyle = oPipeDocument.StructureStyles.Add("Structure Style 01")
 
oStructureStyle.DisplayStylePlan(aeccDispCompStructure).color = 30
oStructureStyle.PlanOption.MaskConnectedObjects = True
 
' Set a structure to use this style.
Set oStructure.Style = oStructureStyle
```
