# Using Pipes

To make a new pipe a meaningful part of a pipe network, it must be connected to structures or other pipes using the `AeccPipe.ConnectToStructure` or `AeccPipe.ConnectToPipe` methods, or structures must be connected to it using the `AeccStructure.ConnectToPipe` method. Connecting pipes together directly creates a new virtual `AeccStructure` object to serve as the joint. If a pipe end is connected to a structure, it must be disconnected before attempting to connect it to a different structure. After a pipe has been connected to a network, you can determine the structures at either end by using the `StartStructure` and `EndStructure` properties or by using the `Connections` property, which is a read-only collection of network parts. There are methods and properties for setting and determining the flow direction, getting all types of physical measurements, and for accessing collections of user-defined properties for custom descriptions of the pipe.

```
' Given a pipe and a structure, join the second endpoint
' of the pipe to the structure.
oPipe.ConnectToStructure aeccPipeEnd, oStructure
 
' Set the flow direction for the pipe.
oPipe.FlowDirectionMethod = aeccPipeFlowDirectionMethodBySlope
 
' Add a custom property to the pipe and assign a value.
Call oPipe.ParamsLong.Add("Custom", 9.2)
Debug.Print "Custom prop:"; oPipe.ParamsLong.Value("Custom")
```
