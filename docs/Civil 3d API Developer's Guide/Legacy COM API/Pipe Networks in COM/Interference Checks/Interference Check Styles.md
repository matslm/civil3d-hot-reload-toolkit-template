# Interference Check Styles

Either a symbol or a model of the actual intersection region can be drawn at each interference location. The display of these intersections is controlled by an `AeccInterferenceStyle` object. The collection of all interference style objects in the document are stored in the `AeccPipeDocument.InterferenceStyles` collection. Set the style of an interference object by assigning an `AeccInterferenceStyle` object to the `AeccInterference.Style` property:

```
Set oInterference.Style = oInterferenceStyle
```

There are three different styles of interference displays you can chose from. First, you can display a 3D model of the intersection region. This is done by setting the `ModelOptions` style property to `aeccTrueSolidInterference`. The `ModelSolidDisplayStyle2D` property, an object of type `AeccDisplayStyle`, controls the visible appearance of the model such as color and line types. Make sure the `ModelSolidDisplayStyle2D.Visible` property is set to `True`.

Another possibility is to draw a 3D sphere at the location of intersection. This is done by setting the `ModelOptions` style property to `aeccSphereInterference`. If the `InterferenceSizeType` property is set to `aeccSolidExtents`, then the sphere is automatically sized to just circumscribe the region of intersection (that is, it is the smallest sphere that still fits the model of the intersection region). You can set the size of the sphere by setting the `InterferenceSizeType` property to `aeccUserDefined`, setting the `ModelSizeOptions` property to use either absolute units or drawing units, and setting the corresponding `AbsoluteModelSize` or `DrawingScaleModelSize` property to the desired value. Again, the `ModelSolidDisplayStyle2D` property controls the visual features such as color and line type. Make sure the `ModelSolidDisplayStyle2D.Visible` property is set to `True`.

The third option is to place a symbol at the location of intersection. Set the `PlanSymbolDisplayStyle2D.Visible` style property to `True` to make symbols visible. The style property `MarkerStyle`, an object of type `AeccMarkerStyle`, controls all aspects of how the symbol is drawn.

This sample creates a new interference style object that displays an X symbol with a superimposed circle at points of intersection:

```
' Create a new interference style object.
Dim oInterferenceStyle As AeccInterferenceStyle
Set oInterferenceStyle = oPipeDocument.InterferenceStyles _
  .Add("Interference style 01")
 
' Draw a symbol of a violet X with circle with a specified
' drawing size at the points of intersection.
oInterferenceStyle.PlanSymbolDisplayStyle2D.Visible = True
With oInterferenceStyle.MarkerStyle
    .MarkerType = aeccUseCustomMarker
    .CustomMarkerStyle = aeccCustomMarkerX
    .CustomMarkerSuperimposeStyle = _
      aeccCustomMarkerSuperimposeCircle
    .MarkerDisplayStylePlan.color = 200 ' violet
    .MarkerDisplayStylePlan.Visible = True
    .MarkerSizeType = aeccAbsoluteUnits
    .MarkerSize = 5.5
End With
' Hide any model display at intersection points.
oInterferenceStyle.ModelSolidDisplayStyle2D.Visible = False
```
