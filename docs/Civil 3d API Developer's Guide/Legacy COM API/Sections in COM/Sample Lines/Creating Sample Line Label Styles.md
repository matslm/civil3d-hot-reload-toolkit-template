# Creating Sample Line Label Styles

The style of sample line text labels, lines, and marks are controlled by an `AeccLabelStyle` object. The style can be set through the `AeccSampleLine.LabelStyle` property or by passing an `AeccLabelStyle` object when using the `AeccSampleLineGroups.Add` method. All labels styles for sample lines are stored in the `AeccDocument.SampleLineLabelStyles` collection. See the Root Objects chapter for more detailed information about the `AeccLabelStyle` class.

Text labels for sample lines can use any of the following property fields:

| Valid property fields for AeccLabelStyleTextComponent.Contents |
