# Creating Sample Line Styles

In creating sample lines, you need to work with three different style objects that control how sample lines are displayed.

## Group Plot Styles

The `AeccGroupPlotStyle` style controls how groups of section view graphs are drawn. The style changes the row and column orientation and spacing between multiple graphs. The collection of all `AeccGroupPlotStyle` styles is contained in the `AeccDocument.GroupPlotStyles` property.

```
Dim oGroupPlotStyle As AeccGroupPlotStyle
Set oGroupPlotStyle = oDocument.GroupPlotStyles _
  .Add("Example group plot style")
```

## Sample Line Styles

The `AeccSampleLineStyle` style controls how sample lines are drawn on a surface. The collection of all `AeccSampleLineStyle` styles is contained in the `AeccDocument.SampleLineStyles` property.

```
Dim oSampleLineStyle As AeccSampleLineStyle
Set oSampleLineStyle = oDocument.SampleLineStyles _
  .Add("Example sample line style")
 
' This style just changes the display of the sample line.
oSampleLineStyle.LineDisplayStyleSection.color = 140 ' slate
```

## Section Styles

The `AeccSectionStyle` style controls how surface cross sections are displayed in the section view graphs. The collection of all `AeccSectionStyle` styles is contained in the `AeccDocument.SectionStyles` property.

```
Dim oSectionStyle As AeccSectionStyle
Set oSectionStyle = oDocument.SectionStyles _
  .Add("Example cross section style")
 
' This style just changes the display of cross section
' lines.
oSectionStyle.SegmentDisplayStyleSection.color = 110 ' green/blue
```
