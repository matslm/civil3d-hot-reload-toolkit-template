# Using Sections

Each sample line contains a collection of sections that were based on that sample line. Each section is represented by object of type `AeccSection` and contains methods for retrieving statistics of the surface along the section. While sections initially have styles based on the `AeccSectionStyle` style passed to the `AeccSampledSurfaces.Add` method, you can also set the style for each section individually through the `AeccSection.Style` property.

```
Dim oSampleLines as AeccSampleLines
Set oSampleLines = oSampleLineGroup.SampleLines
 
' For each sample line, go through all the sections that
' were created based on it.
Dim i As Integer
Dim j As Integer
For i = 0 To oSampleLines.Count - 1
   Dim oSections As AeccSections
   Set oSections = oSampleLines.Item(i).Sections
 
   ' For each section, print its highest elevation and set
   ' some of its properties.
   Dim oSection as AeccSection
   For Each oSection in oSections
      Debug.Print "Max Elevation of "; oSection.Name;
      Debug.Print " is: "; oSection.ElevationMax
       oSection.DataType = aeccSectionDataTIN
      oSection.StaticDynamic = aeccSectionStateDynamic
   Next
Next i
```
