# Creating Point Groups

A point group is a collection that contains a subset of the points in a document. A collection of all point groups is held in a document‘s `AeccDocument.PointGroups` property. Add a new point group by using the `AeccDocument.PointGroups.Add` method and specifying a unique identifying string name. A new empty point group is returned.

```
' Get the collection of all point groups from the document.
Dim oPtGroups As AeccPointGroups
Dim oPtGroup As AeccPointGroup
Set oPtGroups = oAeccDocument.PointGroups
 
' Add our group to the collection of groups.
Set oPtGroup = oPtGroups.Add("Sample point group")
```
