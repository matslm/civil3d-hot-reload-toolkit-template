# Using the Points Collection

All points in a document are held in the `AeccDocument.Points` property, an object of type `AeccPoints`. Besides the usual collection properties and methods, the Points object also has methods for dealing with large numbers of points at once. An array of positions can be added using the `AeccPoints.AddMultiple` method.

The following example adds a series of points to the `AeccDocument.Points` collection using `AddMultiple` and then accesses points in the collection directly:

```
' This adds an array of point locations to the document's
' points collection.
Dim lNumAdded As Long
Const NUM_LOCATIONS As Long = 3
' One dimensional array, 3 for each point location.
Dim dLocations(0 To (3 * NUM_LOCATIONS) - 1) As Double
' One point per line
dLocations(0) = 4927: dLocations(1) = 3887: dLocations(2) = 150
dLocations(3) = 5101: dLocations(4) = 3660: dLocations(5) = 250
dLocations(6) = 5144: dLocations(7) = 3743: dLocations(8) = 350
lNumAdded = oPoints.AddMultiple(NUM_LOCATIONS, dLocations, 0)
 
' This computes the average elevation of all points in a document.
Dim oPoints As AeccPoints
Dim i As Long
Dim avgElevation As Double
Set oPoints = g_oAeccDocument.Points
For i = 0 To oPoints.Count - 1
    avgElevation = avgElevation + oPoints.Item(i).Elevation
Next i
avgElevation = avgElevation / oPoints.Count
MsgBox "Average elevation: "& avgElevation & _
  vbNewLine & "Number of points: " & oPoints.Count
```
