# Accessing Points in a File

The `AeccPoints` object also has methods for reading and writing point locations in a file. The `AeccPoints.ImportPoints` method creates points from locations stored in a text file. The `AeccPoints.ExportPoints` method writes point locations to a text file.

The second parameter of the `ImportPoints` and `ExportPoints` methods is a string that describes how the point values are stored in the file. The following table lists some commonly available file formats. You can create other formats by using the Point File Format dialog box.

Point File Formats

| String Literal | Format of values in the file |
| --- | --- |
| ENZ (comma delimited) | Easting, Northing, Elevation |
| NEZ (space delimited) | Northing Easting Elevation |
| NEZ (comma delimited) | Northing, Easting, Elevation |
| PENZ (space delimited) | Point# Easting Northing Elevation |
| PENZ (comma delimited) | Point#, Easting, Northing, Elevation |
| PENZD (space delimited) | Point# Easting Northing Elevation Description |
| PENZD (comma delimited) | Point#, Easting, Northing, Elevation, Description |
| PNE (space delimited) | Point# Northing Easting |
| PNE (comma delimited) | Point#, Northing, Easting |
| PNEZ (space delimited) | Point# Northing Easting Elevation |
| PNEZ (comma delimited) | Point#, Northing, Easting, Elevation |
| PNEZD (space delimited) | Point# Northing Easting Elevation Description |
| PNEZD (comma delimited) | Point#, Northing, Easting, Elevation, Description |
| ENZ (space delimited) | Easting Northing Elevation |
| Autodesk Uploadable File | Point# Northing Easting Elevation Description |

The third parameter of the `ImportPoints` method is an object of type `AeccPointImportOptions`, which can be set to perform actions as the data is being loaded. For example, you can add offsets to the point positions or elevations, determine which points to read from the file, or specify the point group where the points are placed. The third parameter of the `ExportPoints` method is of the similar `AeccPointExportOptions` type.

This example demonstrates the `ImportPoints` and `ExportPoints` methods:

```
Dim oPoints As AeccPoints
Dim oImportOptions As New AeccPointImportOptions
Dim sFilename As String
Dim sFileFormat As String
Dim iCount As Integer
 
Set oPoints = oDocument.Points
sFilename = "C:\My Documents\SamplePointFile.txt"
sFileFormat = "PENZ (space delimited)"
oImportOptions.PointDuplicateResolution = aeccPointDuplicateOverwrite
iCount = oPoints.ImportPoints(sFilename, sFileFormat, oImportOptions)
 
' Export the files to a separate file.
Dim oExportOptions As New AeccPointExportOptions
sFilename = "C:\My Documents\SamplePointFile2.txt"
oExportOptions.ExpandCoordinateData = True
oPoints.ExportPoints sFilename, sFileFormat, oExportOptions
```

Note:

When you add points using the `ImportPoints` method, it is possible that the point numbers will conflict with those that already exist in the drawing. In such cases, the user is given an option to renumber the point numbers from the file, or to cancel the operation which will result with a Visual Basic error. An application that uses `ImportPoints` should take this into account.
