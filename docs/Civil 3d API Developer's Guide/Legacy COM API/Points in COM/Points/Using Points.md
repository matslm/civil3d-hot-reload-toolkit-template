# Using Points

Each individual point is represented by an object of type `AeccPoint`. The point object contains the identification number, description, and location for the point. The identification number, held in the `Point.Number` property, is unique and is automatically assigned when the point is first created. It cannot be changed. The read-only `Point.FullDescription` property is only meaningful when the point is read from a file that contains description information.

You can access the local position through either the `AeccPoint.Easting` and `AeccPoint.Northing` properties or by using the `AeccPoint.Location` property, a three-element array containing the easting, northing, and elevation. The point’s location can also be specified by using the `AeccPoint.Grideasting` and `AeccPoint.GridNorthing` properties or the `AeccPoint.Latitude` and `AeccPoint.Longitude` properties, depending on the coordinate settings of the drawing.

This sample adds a new point to the document’s collection of points and sets some of its properties.

```
Dim oPoints As AeccPoints
Set oPoints = g_oAeccDocument.Points
Dim oPoint1 As AeccPoint
Dim dLocation(0 To 2) As Double
dLocation(0) = 4958
dLocation(1) = 4078
Set oPoint1 = oPoints.Add(dLocation)
oPoint1.Name = "point1"
oPoint1.RawDescription = "Point Description"
```
