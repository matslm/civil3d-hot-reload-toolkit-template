# Modifying Stations with Station Equations

A station is a point along an alignment a certain distance from the start of the alignment. By default the station at the start point of an alignment is 0 and increases contiguously through its length. This can be changed by using *station equations*, which can renumber stations along an alignment. A station equation is an object of type `AeccStationEquation` which contains a location along the alignment, a new station number basis, and a flag describing whether station values should increase or decrease from that location on. A collection of these station equations is contained in the `AeccAlignment.StationEquations` property.

The following code changes an alignment so that at a point 80 units from the beginning, stations will start being numbered from the value 720:

```
Dim oStationEquation As AeccStationEquation
Set oStationEquation = oAlignment.StationEquations _
  .Add(80, 0, 720, aeccIncreasing)
```

Note:

Some functions, such as `AeccAlignment.InstantaneousRadius`, require a “raw” station value without regard to modifications made by station equations.
