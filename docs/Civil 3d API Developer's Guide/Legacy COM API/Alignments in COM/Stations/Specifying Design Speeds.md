# Specifying Design Speeds

You can assign design speeds along the length of an alignment to aid in the future design of a roadway based on the alignment. The collection of speeds along an alignment are contained in the `AeccAlignment.DesignSpeeds` property. Each item in the collection is an object of type `AeccDesignSpeed`, which contains a raw station value, a speed to be used from that station on until the next design speed specified or the end of the alignment, and an optional string comment.

```
Dim oDesignSpeed As AeccDesignSpeed
' Starting at station 0 + 00.00
Set oDesignSpeed = oAlignment.DesignSpeeds.Add(0#)
oDesignSpeed.Value = 45
oDesignSpeed.Comment = "Straightaway"
 
' Starting at station 4 + 30.00
Set oDesignSpeed = oAlignment.DesignSpeeds.Add(430#)
oDesignSpeed.Value = 30
oDesignSpeed.Comment = "Start of curve"
 
' Starting at station 14 + 27.131 to the end.
Set oDesignSpeed = oAlignment.DesignSpeeds.Add(1427.131)
oDesignSpeed.Value = 35
oDesignSpeed.Comment = "End of curve"
' Make Alignment speed-based
oAlignment.DesignSpeedBased = True
```
