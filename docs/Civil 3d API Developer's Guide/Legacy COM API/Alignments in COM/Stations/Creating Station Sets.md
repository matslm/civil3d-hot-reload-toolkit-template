# Creating Station Sets

Alignment stations are usually labeled at regular intervals. You can compute the number, location, and geometry of stations taken at regular spacings by using the `AeccAlignment.GetStations` method. This function returns a collection of stations based on the desired interval of major and minor stations and the type of station requested. Unless the type of station requested is `aeccEquation`, station values ignore any station equations.

```
Dim oStations As AeccAlignmentStations
 
' If we were to label major stations placed every 100 units
' and minor stations placed every 20, how many labels 
' would this alignment have?
Set oStations = oAlignment.GetStations(aeccAll, 100#, 20#)
Debug.Print "Number of labels: " & oStations.Count
 
' Print the location of each major station in the set.
Dim i as Integer
For i = 0 To oStations.Count - 1
    If (oStations.Item(i).Type = aeccMajor) Then
        Dim j As Integer
        Dim x As Integer
        Dim y As Integer
        j = oStations.Item(i).Station
        x = oStations.Item(i).Easting
        y = oStations.Item(i).Northing
        Debug.Print "Station " & j & " is at:" & x & ", " & y
    End If
Next i
```
