# Creating an Alignment Style

A style governs many aspects of how alignments are drawn, including direction arrows and curves, spirals, and lines within an alignment. All alignment styles are contained in the `AeccDocument.AlignmentStyles` collection. Alignment styles must be added to this collection before being used by an alignment object. A style is normally assigned to an alignment when it is first created, but it can also be assigned to an existing alignment through the `AeccAlignment.Style` property.

```
Dim oAlignmentStyle As AeccAlignmentStyle
Set oAlignmentStyle = oAeccDocument.AlignmentStyles _
  .Add("Sample alignment style")
 
' Do not show direction arrows.
oAlignmentStyle.ArrowDisplayStylePlan.Visible = False 
oAlignmentStyle.ArrowDisplayStyleModel.Visible = False
' Show curves in violet.
oAlignmentStyle.CurveDisplayStylePlan.color = 200 ' violet
oAlignmentStyle.CurveDisplayStyleModel.color = 200 ' violet
' Show straight sections in blue.
oAlignmentStyle.LineDisplayStylePlan.color = 160 ' blue
oAlignmentStyle.LineDisplayStyleModel.color = 160 ' blue
 
' Assign the style to an existing alignment.
oAlignment.Style = oAlignmentStyle.Name
```
