# Alignment Label Styles

The style of text labels and graphical markers displayed along an alignment are set by passing an `AeccAlignmentLabelSet` object when the alignment is first created with the `AeccAlignments.Add` and `AeccAlignments.AddFromPolyline` methods or by assigning the label set object to the `AeccAlignment.LabelStyle` property. The `AeccAlignmentLabelSet` object consists of separate sets of styles to be placed at major stations, minor stations, and where the alignment geometry, design speed, or station equations change.

Labels at major stations are described in the `AeccAlignmentLabelSet.MajorStationLabelSet` property, which is a collection of `AeccLabelMajorStationSetItem` objects. Each `AeccLabelMajorStationSetItem` object consists of a single `AeccLabelStyle` object and a number of properties describing the limits of the labels and the interval between labels along the alignment.

Labels at minor stations are described in the `AeccAlignmentLabelSet.MinorStationLabelSet` property, which is a collection of `AeccLabelMinorStationSetItem` objects. Each `AeccLabelMinorStationSetItem` object consists of a single `AeccLabelStyle` object and a number of properties describing the limits of the labels and the interval between labels along the alignment. When a new `AeccLabelMinorStationSetItem` is created it must reference a parent `AeccLabelMajorStationSetItem` object.

Labels may be placed at the endpoints of each alignment entity. Such labels are controlled through the `AeccAlignmentLabelSet.GeometryPointLabelSet` property, an `AeccLabelSet`. The label set is a collection of `AeccLabelStyle` objects. Labels at each change in alignment design speeds and station equations (the `AeccAlignmentLabelSet.GeometryPointLabelSet` and `AeccAlignmentLabelSet.GeometryPointLabelSet` properties respectively) are also `AeccLabelSet` objects.

All label styles at alignment stations can draw from the following list of property fields:

| Valid property fields for AeccLabelStyleTextComponent.Contents |
| --- |
| <[Station Value(Uft|FS|P0|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |
| <[Raw Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |
| <[Northing(Uft|P4|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Easting(Uft|P4|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Design Speed(P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Instantaneous Direction(Udeg|FDMSdSp|MB|P4|RN|DSn|CU|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Perpendicular Direction(Udeg|FDMSdSp|MB|P4|RN|DSn|CU|AP|OF)]> |
| <[Alignment Name(CP)]> |
| <[Alignment Description(CP)]> |
| <[Alignment Length(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> |
| <[Alignment Start Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |
| <[Alignment End Station(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> |

Label styles for minor stations, geometry points, design speeds, and station equations can also use the following property fields:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <[Offset From Major Station(Uft|P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | Minor stations |
| <[Geometry Point Text(CP)]> | Geometry points |
| <[Geometry Point Entity Before Data(CP)]> | Geometry points |
| <[Geometry Point Entity After Data(CP)]> | Geometry points |
| <[Design Speed Before(P3|RN|AP|Sn|OF)]> | Design speeds |
| <[Station Ahead(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> | Station equations |
| <[Station Back(Uft|FS|P2|RN|AP|Sn|TP|B2|EN|W0|OF)]> | Station equations |
| <[Increase/Decrease(CP)]> | Station equations |
