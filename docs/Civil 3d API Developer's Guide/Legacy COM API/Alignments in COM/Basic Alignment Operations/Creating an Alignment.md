# Creating an Alignment

Alignments are usually created in existing sites. Each `AeccSite` object has its own collection of alignments held in an `AeccAlignments` object in the `AeccSite.Alignments` property. There is also a collection of alignments that are not associated with a site in the `AeccDocument.AlignmentsSiteless` property.

## Creating a New Alignment

The `AeccAlignments` object provides two ways of creating new alignments. The `AeccAlignments.Add` method takes an alignment name, a layer to draw to, an alignment style object, and an alignment label style object as parameters and returns a new empty alignment. The `AeccAlignments.AddFromPolyline` method takes the same parameters as well as an AutoCAD polyline entity and flags indicating whether curves should be added between the separate line segments and whether the polyline entity should be erased after the alignment is created.

This code creates an alignment from a 2D polyline, using existing styles:

```
' Create an alignment style with default settings.
Dim oAlignmentStyle as AeccAlignmentStyle
Set oAlignmentStyle = oDocument.AlignmentStyles _
  .Add("Sample style")
 
' Create an alignment label style with default settings.
Dim oAlignmentLabelStyleSet As AeccAlignmentLabelStyleSet
Set oAlignmentLabelStyleSet = oAeccDocument.AlignmentLabelStyleSets _
  .Add("Sample label style")
 
' Get the collection of all siteless alignments.
Dim oAlignments as AeccAlignments
Set oAlignments = oDocument.AlignmentsSiteless
 
' Create an empty alignment that draws to layer 0.
Dim oAlignment as AeccAlignment
Set oAlignment = oAlignments.Add("Sample Alignment", "0", _
  oAlignmentStyle.Name, oAlignmentLabelStyleSet.Name)
 
 
' Create a simple 2D polyline.
Dim oPoly As AcadLWPolyline
Dim dPoints(0 To 5) As Double
dPoints(0) = 0: dPoints(1) = 600
dPoints(2) = 600: dPoints(3) = 0
dPoints(4) = 1200: dPoints(5) = 600
Set oPoly = oDocument.Database.ModelSpace _
  .AddLightWeightPolyline(dPoints)
 
' Create an alignment from the polyline object. Draw to
' layer 0, erase the polyline when we are done, and
' insert curves between line segments.
Set oAlignment = oAlignments.AddFromPolyline( _
  "Sample Alignment from Polyline", _
  "0", _
  oPoly.ObjectID, _
  oAlignmentStyle.Name, _
  oAlignmentLabelStyleSet.Name, _
  True, _
  True)
```

## Creating an Alignment Offset From Another Alignment

Alignments can also be created based on the layout of existing alignments. The `AeccAlignment.Offset` method creates a new alignment with a constant offset and adds it to the same parent site as the original alignment. The new alignment has the same name (followed by a number in parenthesis) and the same style as the original, but it does not inherit any station labels, station equations, or design speeds from the original alignment.

```
' Add an offset alignment 10.5 units to the left of the
' original.
oAlignment.Offset -10.5
```
