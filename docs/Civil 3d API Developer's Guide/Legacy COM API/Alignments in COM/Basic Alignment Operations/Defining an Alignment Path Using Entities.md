# Defining an Alignment Path Using Entities

An alignment is made up of a series of *entities*, which are individual lines, curves, and spirals that make up the path of an alignment. A collection of entities is held in the `AeccAlignment.Entities` collection. This collection has a wide array of methods for creating new entities.

The following code sample demonstrates some of the entity creation methods:

```
' Define the points used to create the entities.
Dim point1(0 To 2) As Double
Dim point2(0 To 2) As Double
Dim point3(0 To 2) As Double
point1(0) = 200: point1(1) = 800: point1(2) = 0
point2(0) = 600: point1(1) = 400: point1(2) = 0
point3(0) = 1000: point1(1) = 800: point1(2) = 0
 
' Create a line segment entity that connects two points.
Dim oAlignmentTangent As AeccAlignmentTangent
Set oAlignmentTangent = oAlignment.Entities _
  .AddFixedLine1(point1, point2)
 
' Print the length of the line segment.
Debug.Print oAlignmentTangent.Length
 
' Create a curve entity that connects the second endpoint 
' of the fixed line to another point. The radius of the
' curve depends on the direction of the fixed line and the
' location of the second endpoint.
Dim oAlignmentArc As AeccAlignmentArc
Set oAlignmentArc = oAlignment.Entities _
  .AddFloatingCurve6(oAlignmentTangent.id, point3)
 
' Print the angle of direction at the second endpoint.
Debug.Print oAlignmentArc.EndDirection
```
