# Determining Entities Within an Alignment

Each of the entities in the `AeccAlignment.Entities` collection is a type derived from the `AeccAlignmentEntity`. By checking the `AeccAlignmentEntity.Type` property, you can determine the specific type of each entity and cast the reference to the correct type.

The following sample loops through all entities in an alignment, determines the type of entity, and prints one of its properties.

```
Debug.Print "Number of Entities: "; oAlignment.Entities.Count
 
Dim i as Integer
For i = 0 To oAlignment.Entities.Count - 1
    Select Case (oAlignment.Entities.Item(i).Type)
    Case aeccTangent
        Dim oTangent As AeccAlignmentTangent
        Set oTangent = oAlignment.Entities.Item(i)
        Debug.Print "Tangent length:" & oTangent.Length
    Case aeccArc
        Dim oArc As AeccAlignmentArc
        Set oArc = oAlignment.Entities.Item(i)
        Debug.Print "Arc radius:" & oArc.Radius
    Case aeccSpiral
        Dim oSpiral As AeccAlignmentSpiral
        Set oSpiral = oAlignment.Entities.Item(i)
        Debug.Print "Spiral A value:" & oSpiral.A
    Case aeccSpiralCurveSpiralGroup
        Dim oSCSGroup As AeccAlignmentSCSGroup
        Set oSCSGroup = oAlignment.Entities.Item(i)
        Debug.Print "Radius of curve in SCS group:" _
          & oSCSGroup.Arc.Radius
 
    ' And so on for AeccAlignmentSTSGroup,
    ' AeccAlignmentSTGroup, AeccAlignmentTSGroup
    ' AeccAlignmentSCGroup, and AeccAlignmentCSGroup types.
    End Select
Next i
```

Each entity has an identification number contained in its `AeccAlignmentEntity.Id` property. Each entity knows the numbers of the entities before and after it in the alignment, and you can access specific entities by identification number through the `AeccAlignmentEntities.EntityAtId` method.
