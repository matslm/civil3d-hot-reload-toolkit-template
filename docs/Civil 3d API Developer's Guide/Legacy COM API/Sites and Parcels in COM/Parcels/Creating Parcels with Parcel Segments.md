# Creating Parcels with Parcel Segments

While a site contains a collection of parcels, this collection has no `Add` method. Instead, parcels are automatically generated from the parcel segments added to the `AeccSite.ParcelSegments` collection. A parcel segment is a 2-dimensional line, curve, or AutoCAD entity. Once a closed structure can be formed from the segments in the site, a parcel is automatically formed. Each additional parcel segment that forms new closed structures creates additional parcels. This may affect the shape of existing parcels - if an existing parcel is bisected by a new segment, the existing parcel is reduced in size and a new parcel is formed.

```
Dim oSegments as AeccParcelSegments
Set oSegments = oSite.ParcelSegments
 
' Parcel 1
Call oSegments.AddLine(0, 0, 0, 200)
Call oSegments.AddCurve(0, 200, -0.5, 200, 200)
Call oSegments.AddLine(200, 200, 200, 0)
Call oSegments.AddLine(200, 0, 0, 0)
 
' Parcel 2
Call oSegments.AddCurve2(200, 200, 330, 240, 400, 200)
Call oSegments.AddLine(400, 200, 400, 0)
 
' This will complete parcel 2, as well as form parcel 3.
Dim oPolyline As AcadPolyline
Dim dPoints(0 To 8) As Double
dPoints(0) = 400: dPoints(1) = 0: dPoints(2) = 0
dPoints(3) = 325: dPoints(4) = 25: dPoints(5) = 0
dPoints(6) = 200: dPoints(7) = 0: dPoints(8) = 0
Set oPolyline = oAeccDocument.Database.ModelSpace_
  .AddPolyline(dPoints)
oPolyline.Closed = True
' Passing True as the second parameter deletes the
' polyline entity once the parcel segment has been created.
Call oSegments.AddFromEntity(oPolyline, True)
```
