# Using Sites

A site represents a distinct group of alignments and parcels. Besides containing collections of parcels and alignments, the `AeccSite` object also contains properties describing how the site objects are numbered and displayed.

```
' NextAutoCounterParcel sets the starting identification
' number for newly created parcels.  The first parcel
' created from parcel segments will be 300, the next 301,
' and so on.
oSite.NextAutoCounterParcel = 300
```
