# Accessing and Using the Database Object

Each document has an associated database object of type `AeccDatabase` that is accessed through the `AeccDocument.Database` property. The database object is inherited from the AutoCAD ObjectARX object `AcadDatabase`. The `AeccDatabase` object contains references to all the same Autodesk Civil 3D entities as the `AeccDocument` object. However, it is the only object that contains references to base AutoCAD entities. See the AutoCAD ObjectARX documentation for more information.

```
' Add a polyline to the drawing's collection of objects.
Dim oPolyline As AcadPolyline
Dim dPoints(0 To 8) As Double
dPoints(0) = 1000: dPoints(1) = 1000: dPoints(2) = 0
dPoints(3) = 1000: dPoints(4) = 4000: dPoints(5) = 0
dPoints(6) = 4000: dPoints(7) = 4000: dPoints(8) = 0
' The database is where all such objects are stored.
Set oPolyline = oDocument.Database.ModelSpace.AddPolyline(dPoints)
oPolyline.Closed = True
```

The `AeccDatabase` object also has an `AddEvent()` method, that lets you send an event to the Event Viewer in the Autodesk Civil 3D user interface:

```
Dim oAeccApp As AeccApplication
Set oAeccApp = ThisDrawing.Application.GetInterfaceObject("AeccXUiLand.AeccApplication.6.0")
oAeccApp.Init ThisDrawing.Application
Dim oDatabase As AeccDatabase
Set oDatabase = oAeccApp.ActiveDocument.Database
oDatabase.AddEvent aeccEventMessageError, "PipeLengthRule", "Parameter Bad"
```
