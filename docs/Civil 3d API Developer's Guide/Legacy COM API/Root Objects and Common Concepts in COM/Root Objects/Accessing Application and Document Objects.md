# Accessing Application and Document Objects

The root object in the Autodesk Civil 3D COM hierarchy is the `AeccApplication` object. It contains information about the main application window, base AutoCAD objects, and a collection of all open documents. `AeccApplication` is inherited from the AutoCAD object `AcadApplication`. See the AutoCAD ObjectARX documentation for information about all inherited methods and properties.

The `AeccApplication` object is accessed by first using the exposed `ThisDrawing` object, an AutoCAD object of type `AcadDocument`. Its `AcadDocument.Application` property returns the AutoCAD `AcadApplication` object. From this point, use COM Automation to get the desired Autodesk Civil 3D`AeccApplication` object.

This example demonstrates the process of accessing the `AeccApplication` and `AeccDocument` objects:

```
Dim oAcadApp As AcadApplication
Set oAcadApp = ThisDrawing.Application
' Specify the COM name of the object we want to access.
' Note that this always accesses the most recent version
' of Autodesk Civil 3D installed.
Const sCivilAppName = "AeccXUiLand.AeccApplication.6.0"
Dim oCivilApp As AeccApplication
Set oCivilApp = oAcadApp.GetInterfaceObject(sCivilAppName)
 
' Now we can use the AeccApplication object.
' Get the AeccDocument representing the currently
' active drawing.
Dim oDocument As AeccDocument
Set oDocument = oCivilApp.ActiveDocument
' Set the viewport of the current drawing so that all
' drawing elements are visible.
oCivilApp.ZoomExtents
```

This sample gets the objects from Autodesk Civil 3D 2009. To gain access to the libraries of an older version, use the version number of the desired libraries to the COM object name. For example, to make a program that works with Autodesk Civil 3D 2007, replace:

```
Const sCivilAppName = "AeccXUiLand.AeccApplication.4.0"
```

with the following line of code:

```
Const sCivilAppName = "AeccXUiLand.AeccApplication.6.0"
```

The application object contains references to all open documents in the `AeccApplication.Documents` collection and the `AeccApplication.ActiveDocument` property. `AeccDocument` is inherited from the AutoCAD object `AcadDocument`. See the AutoCAD ObjectARX documentation for information on all inherited methods and properties.
