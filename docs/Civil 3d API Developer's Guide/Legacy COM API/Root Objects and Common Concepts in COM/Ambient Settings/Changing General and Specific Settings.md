# Changing General and Specific Settings

Ambient settings are default properties and styles that apply to the drawing as a whole or to objects when they are first created. The document’s settings are accessed through the properties of the `AeccSettingsRoot` object, which is obtained from the `AeccDocument.Settings` property. There are settings for objects and commands. The object properties define the settings for items in general, or of particular classes of items, such as alignments, gradings, parcels, points, profiles, profile views, sample lines, sections, section views, and surfaces. Although each of these objects are unique, they all share some common features:

| Property Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `StyleSettings` | Specifies the default styles and label styles. |
| `LabelStyleDefaults` | Specifies the common attributes for labels. |
| `NameTemplate` | Specifies the standard pattern of names. |
| `AmbientSettings` | Specifies which units of measurement are used and displayed. |
| `CreationSettings` | Not on all objects. Optional. Specifies item-specific default values. |

The command settings apply to commands, and correspond to the settings in the Commands folder for each item in the Autodesk Civil 3DToolspace Settings Tab.

The following sample determines what angle units are used for all displays related to points:

```
Dim oPointSettings as AeccSettingsPoint
Set oPointSettings = oDocument.Settings.PointSettings
Dim oAmbientSettings as AeccSettingsAmbient
Set oAmbientSettings = oPointSettings.AmbientSettings
Dim oAngleUnit as AeccAngleUnitType
Set oAngleUnit = oAmbientSettings.AngleSettings.Unit.Value
 
If (oAngleUnit = aeccAngleUnitDegree) Then
    ' Units are displayed in degrees
ElseIf (oAngleUnit = aeccAngleUnitRadian) Then
    ' Units are displayed in radians
Else
    ' Units are displayed in gradians
End If
```
