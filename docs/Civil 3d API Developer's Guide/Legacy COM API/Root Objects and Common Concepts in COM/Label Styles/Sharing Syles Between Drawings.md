# Sharing Syles Between Drawings

Label styles, like all style objects, can be shared between drawings. To do this, call the style’s `exportTo` method, targeting the drawing you want to add the style to. In this example, the first style in the `MajorStationLabelStyles` collection is exported from the active drawing to another open drawing named Drawing1.dwg:

```
Dim oDocument As AeccDocument
Set oDocument = oCivilApp.ActiveDocument
Dim dbDestination As AeccDatabase
Set dbDestination = oCivilApp.Documents("Drawing1.dwg").Database
Call oDocument.AlignmentLabelStyles.MajorStationLabelStyles(0).ExportTo(dbDestination)
```
