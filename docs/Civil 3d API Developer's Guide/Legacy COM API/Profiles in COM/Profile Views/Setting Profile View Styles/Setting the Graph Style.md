# Setting the Graph Style

The graph is managed by an object of type `AeccGraphStyle`. This object can be used to change the grid and the title of the graph. The grid is controlled by the `AeccGraphStyle.GridStyle` property, an object of type `AeccGridStyle`. The grid style sets the amount of empty space above and below the extents of the section through the `AeccGridStyle.GridsAboveMaxElevation` and `AeccGridStyle.GridsBelowDatum` properties. The grid style also manages the line styles of major and minor vertical and horizontal gridlines with the `AeccGridStyle` properties `MajorVerticalDisplayStylePlan`, `MajorHorizontalDisplayStylePlan`, `MinorVerticalDisplayStylePlan`, and `MinorHorizontalDisplayStylePlan`. The `AeccGridLines.VerticalPosition` and `AeccGridLines.HorizontalPosition` properties tell which axis to use to position the grid lines.

## Graph Title

The title of the graph is controlled by the `AeccGraphStyle.TitleStyle` property, an object of type `AeccGraphTitleStyle`. The title style object can adjust the position, style, and border of the title. The text of the title can include any of the following property fields:
