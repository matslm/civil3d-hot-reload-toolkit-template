# Assemblies and Subassemblies

An assembly is a pattern for the cross section of a corridor at a particular station. An assembly consists of a connected set of subassemblies, each of which are linked to a centerpoint or to other subassemblies. A subassembly consists of a series of shapes, links, and points. When an assembly is used to define the cross-section of a corridor, a series of applied assemblies (an object of type `AeccAppliedAssembly`) is added to the corridor. Each applied assembly consists of a collection of applied subassemblies, which in turn consist of shapes, links, and points that have been positioned relative to a specific station along the corridor baseline (`AeccCalcualtedShapes`, `AeccCalculatedLinks`, and `AeccCalculatedPoints` respectively). An applied assembly also has direct access to all the calculated shapes, links, and points of its constituent applied subassemblies.

Note:

The Autodesk Civil 3D API does not include methods for creating or modifying assemblies.
