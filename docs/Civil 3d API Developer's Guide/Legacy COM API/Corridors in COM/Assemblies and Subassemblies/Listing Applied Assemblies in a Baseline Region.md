# Listing Applied Assemblies in a Baseline Region

The collection of all applied assemblies used in a baseline region are contained in the `AeccBaselineRegion.AppliedAssemblies` property.

The following sample displays information about the construction of an assembly for every assembly in a baseline region:

```
Dim oAppliedAssembly As AeccAppliedAssembly
For Each oAppliedAssembly In oBaselineRegion.AppliedAssemblies
    Debug.Print "Applied Assembly"
    Dim lCount As Long
    lCount = oAppliedAssembly.GetShapes().Count
    Debug.Print "  Num Shapes: " & lCount
    Debug.Print
    lCount = oAppliedAssembly.GetLinks().Count
    Debug.Print "  Num Links: " & lCount
    lCount = oAppliedAssembly.GetPoints().Count
    Debug.Print "  Num Points: " & lCount
Next
```

An `AeccAppliedAssembly` object does not contain its baseline station position. Instead, each calculated point contains a method for determining its position with a baseline station, offset, and elevation called `AeccCalculatedPoint.GetStationOffsetElevationToBaseline`. Each calculated shape contains a collection of all links that form the shape, and each calculated link contains a collection of all points that define the link. Finally, each shape, link, and point contain an array of all corridor codes that apply to that element.

This sample retrieves all calculated point in an applied assembly and prints their locations:

```
Dim oPoint As AeccCalculatedPoint
For Each oPoint In oAppliedAssembly.GetPoints()
   Dim vPos As Variant
   vPos = oPoint.GetStationOffsetElevationToBaseline()
   Debug.Print "Position:  Station = " & vPos(0) & _
     " Offset = " & vPos(1) & " Elevation = " & vPos(2)
Next
```
