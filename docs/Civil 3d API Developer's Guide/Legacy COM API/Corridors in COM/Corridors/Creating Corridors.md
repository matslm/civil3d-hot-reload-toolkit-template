# Creating Corridors

The corridors collection includes a `AeccCorridors.Add` method for creating new corridors. This method creates the corridor based on an existing alignment, profile, and assembly.

Note:

The station distance between assemblies cannot be set through the API, and needs to be set through the property page dialog box before the `AeccCorridors.Add` method is called.

```
' Assuming oAlignment, oProfile, and oAssembly represent
' valid AeccAlignment, AeccProfile, and AeccAssembly objects.
Dim oCorridors As AeccCorridors
Set oCorridors = oRoadwayDocument.Corridors
Dim oCorridor As AeccCorridor
Set oCorridor = oCorridors.Add( _
  "Corridor01", _
  oAlignment.Name, _
  oProfile.Name, _
  oAssembly.Name)
```
