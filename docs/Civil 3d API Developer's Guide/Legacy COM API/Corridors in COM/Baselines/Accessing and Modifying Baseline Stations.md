# Accessing and Modifying Baseline Stations

Assembly cross sections are placed at regular intervals along a baseline. The list of all stations where assemblies are located along a baseline can be retrieved using the `AeccBaseline.GetSortedStations` method while all stations along a baseline region can be retrieved using the `AeccBaselineRegion.GetSortedStations` method.

```
Dim v As Variant
v = oBaselineRegion.GetSortedStations()
Dim i As Integer
Debug.Print "Assembly stations:"
For i = 0 To UBound(v)
    Debug.Print v(i)
Next i
```

New stations can be added to baselines and baseline regions using the `AddStation` method. Existing stations can be deleted using the `DeleteStation` method. `DeleteStation` includes an optional `tolerance` parameter, letting you specify a station within a range. You can list all of the stations added to a baseline region with the `AeccBaselineRegion.GetAdditionalStation` method. `AeccBaselineRegion.ClearAdditionalStations` removes all added stations within a baseline region and leaves only the original stations created at regular intervals.

```
' Add an assembly to the baseline at station 12+34.5
oBaseline.AddStation 1234.5, "Station description"
 
' Remove the station located within 0.1 units around 5+67.5
oBaseline.DeleteStation 567.5, 0.1
```
