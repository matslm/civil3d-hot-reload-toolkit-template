# Listing Corridor Surfaces

The collection of all corridor surfaces for each corridor is held in the the `AeccCorridor.CorridorSurfaces` property. Each corridor surface contains the boundary of the surface and a list of all point, link, and feature line codes used in the construction of the surface. Corridor surfaces also contain read-only references to the surface style and section style used in drawing the surface.

Note:

The Autodesk Civil 3D API does not include methods for creating new corridor surfaces or modifying existing corridor surfaces.

This sample lists all the corridor surfaces within a corridor and specifies which point codes were used:

```
Dim oCorridorSurface As AeccCorridorSurface
For Each oCorridorSurface In oCorridor.CorridorSurfaces
    Debug.Print "Surface name: "; oCorridorSurface.Name
 
    ' Get the point codes that were used to construct
    ' this surface.
    Dim sCodes() As String
    Dim sCodeList As String
    Dim i as Integer
    sCodes = oCorridorSurface.PointCodes
    For i = 0 To UBound(sCodes)
        sCodeList = sCodeList & " " & sCodes(i)
    Next i
    Debug.Print "Point codes: " & sCodeList
Next
```
