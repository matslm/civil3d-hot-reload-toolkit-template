# Listing Surface Boundaries

Two different objects are used to define the limits of a corridor surface: boundaries and masks. A boundary is a polygon representing the outer edge of a surface or the inside edge of a hole in a surface. A mask is a polygon representing the part of the surface that can be displayed. The collection of all the boundaries of a surface are stored in the `AeccCorridorSurface.Boundaries` property and the collection of all masks are stored in the `AeccCorridorSurface.Masks` property.

Boundaries (of type `AeccCorridorSurfaceBoundary`) and masks (of type `AeccCorridorSurfaceMask`) are both derived from the same base interface (`IAeccCorridorSurfaceBaseMask`) and both have the similar methods and properties. The array of points making up the border polygon is retrieved by calling the `GetPolygonPoints` method. If the border was originally defined by selecting segments of feature lines, the collection of all such feature line components are contained in the `FeatureLineComponents` property.

Note:

The Autodesk Civil 3D API does not include methods for creating or modifying corridor boundaries or masks.

This sample loops through all the boundaries of a corridor surface and displays information about each:

```
Dim oCSBoundary As AeccCorridorSurfaceBoundary
 
For Each oCSBoundary In oCorridorSurface.Boundaries
   ' Get the type of boundary.
   Dim sBoundaryTitle As String
   If (oCSBoundary.Type = aeccCorridorSurfaceInsideBoundary) Then
      sBoundaryTitle = "  Inner Boundary: "
   Else
      sBoundaryTitle = "  Outer Boundary: "
   End If
   Debug.Print sBoundaryTitle & oCSBoundary.Name
 
   ' Get the points of the boundary polygon.
   Dim vPoints As Variant
   vPoints = oCSBoundary.GetPolygonPoints()
   Debug.Print " " & UBound(vPoints) & " points" 
   ' Print the location of the first point. Usually corridors
   ' have a large number of boundary points, so we will not
   ' bother printing all of them.
   X = vPoints(1)(0)
   Y = vPoints(1)(1)
   Z = vPoints(1)(2)
   Debug.Print "Point 1: "; X; ", "; Y; ", "; Z
 
   ' Display information about each feature
   ' line component in this surface boundary.
   Debug.Print 
   Debug.Print "Feature line components"
   Debug.Print " Count: "; 
   Debug.Print oCSBoundary.FeatureLineComponents.Count
 
   Dim oFeatureLineComponent As AeccFeatureLineComponent
   For Each oFLineComponent In oCSBoundary.FeatureLineComponents
      Debug.Print "Code:" & oFLineComponent.FeatureLine.CodeName
      Debug.Print "Start station:" & oFLineComponent.StartStation
      Debug.Print "End station:" & oFLineComponent.EndStation
      Debug.Print: Debug.Print
   Next ' Feature line components
Next ' Corridor surface boundaries
```
