# Accessing Corridor-Specific Base Objects

Applications that access corridors require special versions of the base objects representing the application and document. The `AeccRoadwayApplication` object is identical to the `AeccApplication` it is inherited from except that its `AeccRoadwayApplication.ActiveDocument` property returns an object of type `AeccRoadwayDocument` instead of `AeccDocument`. The `AeccRoadwayDocument` object contains collections of road related items, such as corridors, subassemblies, and style objects in addition to all of the methods and properties of `AeccDocument`.

When using corridor root objects, be sure to reference the “Autodesk Civil Engineering Corridor 6.0 Object Library” (AeccXRoadway.tlb) and “Autodesk Civil Engineering UI Corridor 6.0 Object Library” (AeccXUIRoadway.tlb) libraries.

This sample demonstrates how to retrieve the corridor root objects:

```
Dim oApp As AcadApplication
Set oApp = ThisDrawing.Application
Dim sAppName As String
sAppName = "AeccXUiRoadway.AeccRoadwayApplication"
Dim oRoadwayApplication As AeccRoadwayApplication
Set oRoadwayApplication = oApp.GetInterfaceObject(sAppName)
 
' Get a reference to the currently active document.
Dim oRoadwayDocument As AeccRoadwayDocument
Set oRoadwayDocument = oRoadwayApplication.ActiveDocument
```
