# Listing Feature Lines Along Offset Baselines

As there can be many offset baselines in a single main baseline, the list of all feature lines along all offset baselines contains an extra layer. The `AeccBaseline.OffsetBaselineFeatureLinesCol` property contains a collection of `AeccBaselineFeatureLines` objects. These `AeccBaselineFeatureLines` objects not only contain the feature lines just as for the main baseline, but also contain properties identifying which offset baseline each group of feature lines belong to.

This sample shows how to modify the previous sample for feature lines along offset baselines:

```
Dim oBFeatureLinesCol As AeccBaselineFeatureLinesCol
Set oBFeatureLinesCol = oBaseline.OffsetBaselineFeatureLinesCol
 
Dim oBaselineFeatureLines As AeccBaselineFeatureLines
' Loop through the groups of collections, one group for each
' offset baseline.
For Each oBaselineFeatureLines In oBFeatureLinesCol
 
   Dim oFeatureLinesCol As AeccFeatureLinesCol
   Set oFeatureLinesCol = oBaselineFeatureLines.FeatureLinesCol
   Debug.Print "# line collections:" & oFeatureLinesCol.Count
 
   ' [...]
   ' This section is the same as the previous topic.
 
Next ' Groups of collections of feature lines
```

Each offset baseline and hardcoded offset baseline also has direct access to the feature lines related to itself. The `AeccBaselineFeatureLines` collection is accessed through the `RelatedOffsetBaselineFeatureLines` property in both types of offset baselines.
