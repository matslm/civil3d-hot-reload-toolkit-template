# Listing Feature Lines Along a Baseline

The set of all feature lines along a main baseline are held in the `AeccBaseline.MainBaselineFeatureLines` property, an object of type `AeccBaselineFeatureLines`. This object contains information about all the feature lines, such as a list of all codes used. Its `AeccBaselineFeatureLines.FeatureLinesCol` property is a collection of collections of feature lines. Each feature line (an object of type `AeccFeatureLine`) contains the code string used to create the feature line and a collection of all feature line points.

This sample lists all the feature line collections and feature lines along the main baseline. It also lists the code and every point location for each feature line.

```
Dim oBaselineFeatureLines As AeccBaselineFeatureLines
Set oBaselineFeatureLines = oBaseline.MainBaselineFeatureLines
 
Dim oFeatureLinesCol As AeccFeatureLinesCol
Set oFeatureLinesCol = oBaselineFeatureLines.FeatureLinesCol
Debug.Print "# line collections:" & oFeatureLinesCol.Count
 
Dim oFeatureLines As AeccFeatureLines
For Each oFeatureLines In oFeatureLinesCol
   Debug.Print "Feature Line collection"
   Debug.Print "# lines in collection: " & oFeatureLines.Count
   Dim oFeatureLine As AeccFeatureLine
   For Each oFeatureLine In oFeatureLines
      Debug.Print
      Debug.Print "Feature Line code: " & oFeatureLine.CodeName
 
      ' Print out all point locations of the
      ' feature line.
      Dim oFeatureLinePoint As AeccFeatureLinePoint
      For Each oFeatureLinePoint In oFeatureLine.FeatureLinePoints
         Dim X As Double
         Dim Y As Double
         Dim Z As Double
         X = oFeatureLinePoint.XYZ(0)
         Y = oFeatureLinePoint.XYZ(1)
         Z = oFeatureLinePoint.XYZ(2)
         Debug.Print "Point: " & X & ", " & Y & ", " & Z
      Next ' Points in a feature line
   Next ' Feature lines
Next ' Collections of feature lines
```
