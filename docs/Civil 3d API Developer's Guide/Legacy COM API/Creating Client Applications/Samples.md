# Samples

All of the following are located in the **<installation-directory>\Sample\Civil 3D API\COM** directory.

## C++ Using COM

**.\VC++\COM C++\ProjectStats.vcproj**

Directly launches Autodesk Civil 3D and creates a dialog box that displays some information about the current drawing or adds sample lines into the alignments of any selected sites.

## Managed C++

**.\VC++\Managed C++\C3DManagedExample.vcproj**

Using COM interops, launches Autodesk Civil 3D and creates a dialog box that displays some information about the current drawing or adds sample lines into the alignments of any selected sites.

## C++ Using CustomDraw

**.\VC++\CustomDraw\Sample\C3DCustomDraw.vcproj**

Demonstrates accessing the CustomDraw API. This project overrides how triangles in TIN surfaces are drawn so that they’re numbered. It requires the Autodesk ObjectARX libraries.

## C++ Using Custom Events
