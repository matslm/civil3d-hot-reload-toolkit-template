# Ribbon Elements (.NET)

The ribbon provides a location for tools that are frequently accessed and relevant to the current workspace.

It is organized in to tabs, which are like menus on a toolbar. Each tabs contains one or more panels of which contain items that perform different operations.

`Autodesk.Windows` is the managed namespace which contains classes and enumerations associated with the ribbon.

## Tabs

Tabs are the initial navigation interface within a ribbon. The
`RibbonTab` class used to create tabs.

There are two types:

* **ActiveTab** - This represents a tab that is currently selected.
* **ActiveContextualTab** - This represents a tab that is displayed only when a particular type of AutoCAD object, such as a hatch or a table, is included in the selection.

## Panels

A panel contains all the tools associated with a tab. Classes with the prefix
`RibbonPanel` control the various aspects of a panel, such as its visibility, its size, and its floating location.

`RibbonRow` objects define rows within the panel where items are placed. These rows are added to a
`RibbonPanelSource` object, which contains the panel definition for panels displayed in the ribbon.

## Items

Items may be one of two things. They could be the individual tools contained within a panel—such as buttons (`RibbonButton`) or forms (`RibbonForm`); or they could a visual divider—such as a row panel (`RibbonRowPanel`) or a separator (`RibbonSeparator`).
`RibbonItem` is the parent class for both these types.

Within the items themselves exist other subclasses, such as
`RibbonDropDownButton`,
`RibbonMenuButton`, or
`RibbonToggleButton` underneath
`RibbonButton`. For more information on these subtypes, see the ObjectARX Managed Class Reference Guide.

## Ribbon Creation Sample

The following is sample code that creates and populates a
`Ribbon` object. The important information here is to follow the hierarchy of construction, e.g. an item must be added to a panel, which must be added to a tab. There are a number of customizable properties available to ribbons as well, such as title text, size, orientation, tooltips, and the image to be displayed.

### C#

```
// First, the button items are created:
RibbonButton button1 = new RibbonButton;
button1.Text = "Button1";

RibbonButton button2 = new RibbonButton;
button2.Text = "Button2";

// These are then added to a row:
RibbonRow row = new RibbonRow();
row.RowItems.Add(button1);
row.RowItems.Add(button2);

// This row is added to a panel source, which is then added to a panel:
RibbonPanelSource panelSource = new RibbonPanelSource();
panelSource.Title = "Panel1";
panelSource.Rows.Add(row);

RibbonPanel panel = new RibbonPanel();
panel.Source = panelSource;

// Last, the panel is added to a tab, which is added to the ribbon:
RibbonTab tab = new RibbonTab();
tab.Title = "Tab1";
tab.Panels.Add(panel);

RibbonControl ribbon = new RibbonControl();
ribbon.Tabs.Add(tab);
```

### VB.NET

```
'' First, the button items are created:
Dim button1 As RibbonButton = New RibbonButton()
button1.Text = "Button1"

Dim button2 As RibbonButton = New RibbonButton()
button2.Text = "Button2"

'' These are then added to a row:
Dim row As RibbonRow = New RibbonRow()
row.RowItems.Add(button1)
row.RowItems.Add(button2)

'' This row is added to a panel source, which is then added to a panel:
Dim panelSource As RibbonPanelSource = New RibbonPanelSource()
panelSource.Title = "Panel1"
panelSource.Rows.Add(row)

Dim panel As RibbonPanel = New RibbonPanel()
panel.Source = panelSource

'' Last, the panel is added to a tab, which is added to the ribbon:
Dim tab As RibbonTab = New RibbonTab()
tab.Title = "Tab1"
tab.Panels.Add(panel)

Dim ribbon As RibbonControl = New RibbonControl()
ribbon.Tabs.Add(tab)
```
