# Use Unicode Characters, Control Codes, and Special Characters (.NET)

You can use Unicode characters, control codes, and special characters in a text string to represent symbols. (All nontext characters must be entered as their ASCII equivalent.)

You can create special characters by entering the following Unicode character strings:

| Unicode character descriptions | |
| --- | --- |
| Unicode character | Description |
| \U+00B0 | Degree symbol |
| \U+00B1 | Plus/minus tolerance symbol |
| \U+2205 | Diameter dimensioning symbol |

In addition to using Unicode characters for special characters, you can specify a special character by including control information in the text string. Use a pair of percent signs (%%) to introduce each control sequence. For example, the following control code works with standard AutoCAD text and PostScript fonts to draw character number *nnn*:

```
%%nnn
```

These control codes work with standard AutoCAD text fonts only:

| Control code descriptions | |
| --- | --- |
| Control code | Description |
| %%o | Toggles overscore mode on and off |
| %%u | Toggles underscore mode on and off |
| %%d | Draws degree symbol |
| %%p | Draws plus and minus tolerance symbol |
| %%c | Draws diameter dimensioning symbol |
| %%% | Draws single percent sign |
