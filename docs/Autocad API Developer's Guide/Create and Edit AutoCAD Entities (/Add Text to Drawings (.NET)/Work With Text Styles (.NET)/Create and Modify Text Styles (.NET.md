# Create and Modify Text Styles (.NET)

New text inherits height, width factor, obliquing angle, and text generation properties from the current text style. To create a text style, create a new instance of a `TextStyleTableRecord` object. Assign the new text style a name using the `Name` property. Then open the `TextStyleTable` object for write and use the `Add` method to create the new text style.

Style names can contain letters, numbers, and the special characters dollar sign ($), underscore (\_), and hyphen (-). AutoCAD converts the characters to uppercase. If you do not enter a style name, the new style will not have a name.

You can modify an existing style by changing the properties of the `TextStyleTableRecord` object. If you want to work with the current text style, use the `TextStyle` property of the `Database` object which holds the object id of the current text style.

You can also update existing text of that style type to reflect the changes. Use the following properties to modify a `TextStyleTableRecord` object:

BigFontFileName
:   Specifies the special shape definition file used for a non-ASCII character set.

FileName
:   Specifies the file associated with a font (character style).

FlagBits
:   Specifies backward text, upside-down text, or both.

Font
:   Specifies the typeface, bold, italic, character set, and pitch and family settings of the text style.

IsVertical
:   Specifies vertical or horizontal text.

ObliquingAngle
:   Specifies the slant of the characters.

TextSize
:   Specifies the character height.

XScale
:   Specifies the expansion or compression of the characters.

If you change an existing style's font or orientation, all text using that style is changed to use the new font or orientation. Changing text height, width factor, and oblique angle does not change existing text but does change subsequently created text objects.

Note: The drawing must be regenerated to see any changes to the above properties.
