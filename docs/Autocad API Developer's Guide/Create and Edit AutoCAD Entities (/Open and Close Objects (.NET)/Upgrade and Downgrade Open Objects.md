# Upgrade and Downgrade Open Objects (.NET)

An object's current open mode can be changed from read to write or write to read by upgrading or downgrading the object.

These methods can be used to upgrade or downgrade a previously opened object:

* `Transaction.GetObject` method – If the object was opened with the
  `Transaction.GetObject` method, use the method to reopen the object with the desired new open mode.
* `UpgradeOpen` and
  `DowngradeOpen` methods – If the object was opened with the
  `Open` method, or the
  `OpenCloseTransaction.GetObject`, use the
  `UpgradeOpen` method to change the object’s open mode from read to write or
  `DowngradeOpen` method to change the object’s open mode from write to read. You do not need to pair a call to
  `DowngradeOpen` with each
  `UpgradeOpen`, since closing of an object or disposing of a transaction will sufficiently cleanup the open state of an object.

It is recommended to open an object with the mode that best matches how the object will be used, as it is more efficient to open an object for read and query the object’s properties than it is to open the object for write and query the object’s properties. If you are uncertain whether an object might need to be modified, it is best to open the object for read and then upgrade it for write as this helps to reduce the overhead of your program.

                    // Change from read to write mode
                    acTrans.GetObject(acObjId, OpenMode.ForWrite);
