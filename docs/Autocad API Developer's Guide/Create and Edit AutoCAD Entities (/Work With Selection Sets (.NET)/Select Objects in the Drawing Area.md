# Select Objects in the Drawing Area (.NET)

You can select objects through by having the user interactively select objects, or you can simulate many of the various object selection options through the AutoCAD .NET API. If your routine performs multiple selection sets, you will need to either track each selection set returned or create an
`ObjectIdCollection` object to keep track of all the selected objects. The following functions allow you to select objects from the drawing:

GetSelection
:   Prompts the user to pick objects from the screen.

SelectAll
:   Selects all the objects in the drawing.

    Note: Objects in all layouts and spaces are selected, and objects that are locked or frozen.

SelectCrossingPolygon
:   Selects objects within and crossing a polygon defined by specifying points. The polygon can be any shape but cannot cross or touch itself.

SelectCrossingWindow
:   Selects objects within and crossing an area defined by two points.

SelectFence
:   Selects all objects crossing a selection fence. Fence selection is similar to crossing polygon selection except that the fence is not closed, and a fence can cross itself.

SelectLast
:   Selects the last object created in the current space.

SelectPrevious
:   Selects all objects selected during the previous Select objects: prompt.

SelectWindow
:   Selects all objects completely inside a rectangle defined by two points.

SelectWindowPolygon
:   Selects objects completely inside a polygon defined by points. The polygon can be any shape but cannot cross or touch itself.

SelectAtPoint
:   Selects objects passing through a given point and places them into the active selection set.

SelectByPolygon
:   Selects objects within a fence and adds them to the active selection set.

## Prompt for objects on screen and iterate the selection set

This example prompts the user to select objects, then changes the color of each object selected to Green or the AutoCAD Color Index of 3.

            }

            // Save the new object to the database
            acTrans.Commit();
        }

        // Dispose of the transaction

## Select objects with crossing window

This example selects the objects within and that intersect a crossing window.

    // Create a crossing window from (2,2,0) to (10,8,0)
    PromptSelectionResult acSSPrompt;
    acSSPrompt = acDocEd.SelectCrossingWindow(new Point3d(2, 2, 0),
                                              new Point3d(10, 8, 0));

    // If the prompt status is OK, objects were selected
    if (acSSPrompt.Status == PromptStatus.OK)
    {
