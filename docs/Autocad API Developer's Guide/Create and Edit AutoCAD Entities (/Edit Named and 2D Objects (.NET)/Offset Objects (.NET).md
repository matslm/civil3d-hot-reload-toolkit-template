# Offset Objects (.NET)

Offsetting an object creates a new object at a specified offset distance from the original object. You can offset arcs, circles, ellipses, lines, lightweight polylines, polylines, splines, and xlines.

To offset an object, use the
`GetOffsetCurves` method provided for that object. The function requires a positive or negative numeric value for the distance to offset the object. If the distance is negative, it is interpreted by AutoCAD as being an offset to make a “smaller” curve (that is, for an arc it would offset to a radius that is the given distance less than the starting curve's radius). If “smaller” has no meaning, then AutoCAD would offset in the direction of smaller
*X,Y,Z* WCS coordinates.

For many objects, the result of this operation will be a single new curve (which may not be of the same type as the original curve). For example, offsetting an ellipse will result in a spline because the result does fit the equation of an ellipse. In some cases it may be necessary for the offset result to be several curves. Because of this, the function returns a
`DBObjectCollection` object, which contains all the objects that are created by offsetting the curve. The returned
`DBObjectCollection` object needs to be iterated for each object created and then be appended to the drawing database.

## Offset a polyline

This example creates a lightweight polyline and then offsets it.

    using (Transaction acTrans = acCurDb.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())

        BlockTable acBlkTbl;
        acBlkTbl = acTrans.GetObject(acCurDb.BlockTableId,

        BlockTableRecord acBlkTblRec;

        using (Polyline acPoly = new Polyline())

            // Offset the polyline a given distance
            DBObjectCollection acDbObjColl = acPoly.GetOffsetCurves(0.25);

            // Step through the new objects created
            foreach (Entity acEnt in acDbObjColl)
            {
                // Add each offset object

                acTrans.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(acEnt, true);
            }
        }

        // Save the new objects to the database
        acTrans.Commit();
    }
