# Mirror Objects (.NET)

Mirroring flips an object along an axis or mirror line. You can mirror all drawing objects.

To mirror an object, use the
`Mirroring` function of a transformation matrix. This function requires a
`Point3d`,
`Plane`, or
`Line3d` object to define the mirror line. Since mirroring is done with a transformation matrix, a new object is not created. If you want to maintain the original object, you will need to create a copy of the object first and then mirror it.

To manage the reflection properties of
`Text` objects, use the MIRRTEXT system variable. The default setting of MIRRTEXT is On (1), which causes
`Text` objects to be mirrored just as any other object. When MIRRTEXT is Off (0), text is not mirrored. Use the
`GetSystemVariable` and
`SetSystemVariable` methods to query and set the MIRRTEXT setting.

You can mirror a Viewport object in paper space, although doing so has no effect on its model space view or on model space objects.

## Mirror a polyline about an axis

This example creates a lightweight polyline and mirrors that polyline about an axis. The newly created polyline is colored blue.
