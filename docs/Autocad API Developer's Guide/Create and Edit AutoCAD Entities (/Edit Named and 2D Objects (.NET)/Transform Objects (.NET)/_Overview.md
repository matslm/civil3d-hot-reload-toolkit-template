# Transform Objects (.NET)

You move, scale, rotate and mirror an object using a 4 by 4 transformation matrix represented by a
`Matrix3d` object and the
`TransformBy` method. You can also use the
`GetTransformedCopy` method to create a copy of an entity and then apply the transformation to the copy. The
`Matrix3d` object is part of the
`Geometry` namespace.

The first three columns of the matrix specify scale and rotation. The fourth column of the matrix is a translation vector. The following table demonstrates the transformation matrix configuration, where R = Rotation and T = Translation:

| Transformation matrix configuration | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R00 | R01 | R02 | T0 |
| R10 | R11 | R12 | T1 |
| R20 | R21 | R22 | T2 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

To transform an object, first initialize a
`Matrix3d` object. You can initialize the transformation matrix using an array of doubles or starting with a matrix in which represents the World coordinate system or a user coordinate system. Once initialized, you then use the functions of the
`Matrix3d` object to modify the scaling, rotation, or displacement transformation of the matrix.

After the transformation matrix is complete, apply the matrix to the object using the
`TransformBy` method. The following line of code demonstrates applying a matrix (`dMatrix`) to an object (`acObj`):

### C#

```
acObj.TransformBy(dMatrix);
```

### VB.NET

```
acObj.TransformBy(dMatrix)
```

## Example of a rotation matrix

The following shows a single data array to define a transformation matrix, assigned to the variable
`dMatrix`, which will rotate an entity by 90 degrees about the point (0, 0, 0).

| Rotation Matrix: 90 degrees about point (0, 0, 0) | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.0 | -1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |

### C#

Initialize a transformation matrix with a data array in which contains the information to rotate an object 90 degrees.

```
double[] dMatrix = new double[16];
 
dMatrix[0] = 0.0;
dMatrix[1] = -1.0;
dMatrix[2] = 0.0;
dMatrix[3] = 0.0;
dMatrix[4] = 1.0;
dMatrix[5] = 0.0;
dMatrix[6] = 0.0;
dMatrix[7] = 0.0;
dMatrix[8] = 0.0;
dMatrix[9] = 0.0;
dMatrix[10] = 1.0;
dMatrix[11] = 0.0;
dMatrix[12] = 0.0;
dMatrix[13] = 0.0;
dMatrix[14] = 0.0;
dMatrix[15] = 1.0;
 
Matrix3d acMat3d = new Matrix3d(dMatrix);
```

Initialize a transformation matrix without a data array and use the
`Rotation` function to return a transformation matrix that rotates an object 90 degrees.

```
Matrix3d acMat3d = new Matrix3d();
 
acMat3d = Matrix3d.Rotation(Math.PI / 2,
                            curUCS.Zaxis,
                            new Point3d(0, 0, 0));
```

### VB.NET

Initialize a transformation matrix with a data array in which contains the information to rotate an object 90 degrees.

```
Dim dMatrix(0 To 15) As Double
 
dMatrix(0) = 0.0
dMatrix(1) = -1.0
dMatrix(2) = 0.0
dMatrix(3) = 0.0
dMatrix(4) = 1.0
dMatrix(5) = 0.0
dMatrix(6) = 0.0
dMatrix(7) = 0.0
dMatrix(8) = 0.0
dMatrix(9) = 0.0
dMatrix(10) = 1.0
dMatrix(11) = 0.0
dMatrix(12) = 0.0
dMatrix(13) = 0.0
dMatrix(14) = 0.0
dMatrix(15) = 1.0
 
Dim acMat3d As Matrix3d = New Matrix3d(dMatrix)
```

Initialize a transformation matrix without a data array and use the
`Rotation` function to return a transformation matrix that rotates an object 90 degrees.

```
Dim acMat3d As Matrix3d = New Matrix3d()
 
Matrix3d.Rotation(Math.PI / 2, _
                  curUCS.Zaxis, _
                  New Point3d(0, 0, 0))
```
