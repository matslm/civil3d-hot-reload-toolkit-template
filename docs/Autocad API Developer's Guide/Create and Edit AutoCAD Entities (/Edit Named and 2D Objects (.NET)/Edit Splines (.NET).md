# Edit Splines (.NET)

You can edit the properties of an open or closed spline, and even convert it to a polyline. Use the following properties to open or close a spline, change its control points, or reverse the direction of a spline:

Degree
:   Returns the polynomial representation of the spline.

EndFitTangent
:   Returns the end tangent of the spline as a directional vector.

FitTolerance
:   Refits the spline to the existing points with new tolerance values.

NumControlPoints
:   Returns the number of control points for the spline.

NumFitPoints
:   Returns the number of fit points for the spline.

StartFitTangent
:   Returns the start tangent for the spline.

In addition, you can use the following methods to edit splines:

InsertFitPointAt
:   Adds a single fit point to the spline at a given index.

ElevateDegree
:   Increases the degree of the spline to the given degree.

GetControlPointAt
:   Gets the control point of the spline at a given index. (Gets one control point only.) The
    `NumControlPoints` property contains the number of control points of the spline.

GetFitPointAt
:   Gets the fit point of the spline at a given index. (Gets one fit point only. To query all the fit points of the spline, use the
    `FitData` property and then query the
    `FitData` object returned with its
    `GetFitPoints` member function.) The
    `NumFitPoints` property contains the number of fit points of the spline.

RemoveFitPointAt
:   Deletes the fit point of a spline at a given index.

ReverseCurve
:   Reverses the direction of a spline.

SetControlPointAt
:   Sets the control point of the spline at a given index.

SetFitPointAt
:   Sets the fit point of the spline at a given index. (Sets one fit point only. To change all the fit points of the spline, use the
    `FitPoints` property.)

SetWeightAt
:   Sets the weight of the control point at a given index.

Use the following read-only properties to query splines:

Area
:   Gets the enclosed area of a spline.

Closed
:   Indicates whether the spline is open or closed.

Degree
:   Gets the degree of the spline's polynomial representation.

IsPeriodic
:   Specifies if the given spline is periodic.

IsPlanar
:   Specifies if the given spline is planar.

IsRational
:   Specifies if the given spline is rational.

NumControlPoints
:   Gets the number of control points of the spline.

NumfFitPoints
:   Gets the number of fit points of the spline.

## Change a control point on a spline

This example creates a spline and then changes the first control point for the spline.
