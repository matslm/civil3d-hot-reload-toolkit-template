# Create Solid-Filled Areas (.NET)

You can create triangular and quadrilateral areas filled with a color. When creating filled areas, set the FILLMODE system variable to off to improve performance and back on once the fills have been created.

When you create a quadrilateral solid-filled area, the sequence of the third and fourth points determines its shape. Compare the following illustrations:

The first two points define one edge of the polygon. The third point is defined diagonally opposite from the second. If the fourth point is set equal to the third point, then a filled triangle is created.

## Create a solid-filled object

The following example creates a quadrilateral solid (bow-tie) in Model space using the coordinates (0, 0, 0), (5, 0, 0), (5, 8, 0), and (0, 8, 0). It also creates a quadrilateral solid in a rectangular shape using the coordinates (10, 0, 0), (15, 0, 0), (10, 8, 0), and (15, 8, 0).
