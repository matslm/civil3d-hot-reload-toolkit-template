# Create Point Objects (.NET)

`Point` objects can be useful, for example, as node or reference points that you can snap to and offset objects from. You can set the style of the point and its size relative to the screen or in absolute units.

The
`Pdmode` and
`Pdsize` properties of the
`Database` object control the appearance of Point objects. A value of 0, 2, 3, and 4 for
`Pdmode` specify a figure to draw through the point. A value of 1 selects nothing to be displayed.

Adding 32, 64, or 96 to the previous value selects a shape to draw around the point in addition to the figure drawn through it:

`Pdsize` controls the size of the point figures, except for when
`Pdmode` is 0 and 1. A 0 setting generates the point at 5 percent of the graphics area height. Setting
`Pdsize` to a positive value specifies an absolute size for the point figures. A negative value is interpreted as a percentage of the viewport size. The size of all points is recalculated when the drawing is regenerated.

After you change
`Pdmode` and
`Pdsize`, the appearance of existing points changes the next time the drawing is regenerated.

## Create a Point object and change its appearance

The following example creates a
`Point` object in Model space at the coordinate (5, 5, 0). The
`Pdmode` and
`Pdsize` properties are then updated.

### C#

```
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry;
 
[CommandMethod("AddPointAndSetPointStyle")]
public static void AddPointAndSetPointStyle()
{
    // Get the current document and database
    Document acDoc = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument;
    Database acCurDb = acDoc.Database;

    // Start a transaction
    using (Transaction acTrans = acCurDb.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())
    {
        // Open the Block table for read
        BlockTable acBlkTbl;
        acBlkTbl = acTrans.GetObject(acCurDb.BlockTableId,
                                     OpenMode.ForRead) as BlockTable;

        // Open the Block table record Model space for write
        BlockTableRecord acBlkTblRec;
        acBlkTblRec = acTrans.GetObject(acBlkTbl[BlockTableRecord.ModelSpace],
                                        OpenMode.ForWrite) as BlockTableRecord;

        // Create a point at (4, 3, 0) in Model space
        using (DBPoint acPoint = new DBPoint(new Point3d(4, 3, 0)))
        {
            // Add the new object to the block table record and the transaction
            acBlkTblRec.AppendEntity(acPoint);
            acTrans.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(acPoint, true);
        }

        // Set the style for all point objects in the drawing
        acCurDb.Pdmode = 34;
        acCurDb.Pdsize = 1;

        // Save the new object to the database
        acTrans.Commit();
    }
}
```

### VB.NET

```
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry
 
<CommandMethod("AddPointAndSetPointStyle")> _
Public Sub AddPointAndSetPointStyle()
    '' Get the current document and database
    Dim acDoc As Document = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument
    Dim acCurDb As Database = acDoc.Database

    '' Start a transaction
    Using acTrans As Transaction = acCurDb.TransactionManager.StartTransaction()

        '' Open the Block table for read
        Dim acBlkTbl As BlockTable
        acBlkTbl = acTrans.GetObject(acCurDb.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForRead)

        '' Open the Block table record Model space for write
        Dim acBlkTblRec As BlockTableRecord
        acBlkTblRec = acTrans.GetObject(acBlkTbl(BlockTableRecord.ModelSpace), _
                                        OpenMode.ForWrite)

        '' Create a point at (4, 3, 0) in Model space
        Using acPoint As DBPoint = New DBPoint(New Point3d(4, 3, 0))

            '' Add the new object to the block table record and the transaction
            acBlkTblRec.AppendEntity(acPoint)
            acTrans.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(acPoint, True)
        End Using

        '' Set the style for all point objects in the drawing
        acCurDb.Pdmode = 34
        acCurDb.Pdsize = 1

        '' Save the new object to the database
        acTrans.Commit()
    End Using
End Sub
```

### VBA/ActiveX Code Reference

```
Sub AddPointAndSetPointStyle()
    Dim pointObj As AcadPoint
    Dim location(0 To 2) As Double
 
    ' Define the location of the point
    location(0) = 4#: location(1) = 3#: location(2) = 0#
 
    ' Create the point
    Set pointObj = ThisDrawing.ModelSpace.AddPoint(location)
    ThisDrawing.SetVariable "PDMODE", 34
    ThisDrawing.SetVariable "PDSIZE", 1
 
    ZoomAll
End Sub
```
