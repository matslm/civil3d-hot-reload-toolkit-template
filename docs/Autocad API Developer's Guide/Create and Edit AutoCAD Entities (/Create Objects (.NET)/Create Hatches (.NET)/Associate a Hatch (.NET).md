# Associate a Hatch (.NET)

You can create associative or nonassociative hatches. Associative hatches are linked to their boundaries and updated when the boundaries are modified. Nonassociative hatches are independent of their boundaries.

To make a hatch associative, set the `Associative` property of the hatch object created to `TRUE`. To make a hatch nonassociative, set the `Associative` property to `FALSE`.

Associativity for hatch must be set before appending the hatch loop. If a hatch object is nonassociative, you can make it associative again by setting the `Associative` property to `TRUE` and re-appending the hatch loop.
