# Handle Application Events (.NET)

Application object events are used to respond to the application window. Once an Application event is registered, it remains registered until AutoCAD is shutdown or the event is unregistered.

The following events are available for the Application object:

BeginCustomizationMode
:   Triggered just before AutoCAD enters customization mode.

BeginDoubleClick
:   Triggered when the mouse button is double clicked.

BeginQuit
:   Triggered just before an AutoCAD session ends.

DisplayingCustomizeDialog
:   Triggered just before the Customize dialog box is displayed.

DisplayingDraftingSettingsDialog
:   Triggered just before the Drafting Settings dialog box is displayed.

DisplayingOptionDialog
:   Triggered just before the Options dialog box is displayed.

EndCustomizationMode
:   Triggered when AutoCAD exits customization mode.

EnterModal
:   Triggered just before a modal dialog box is displayed.

Idle
:   Triggered when AutoCAD text.

LeaveModal
:   Triggered when a modal dialog box is closed.

PreTranslateMessage
:   Triggered just before a message is translated by AutoCAD.

QuitAborted
:   Triggered when an attempt to shutdown AutoCAD is aborted.

QuitWillStart
:   Triggered after the BeginQuit event and before shutdown begins.

SystemVariableChanged
:   Triggered when an attempt to change a system variable is made.

SystemVariableChanging
:   Triggered just before an attempt is made at changing a system variable.

## Enable an Application object event

This example demonstrates how to register an event handler with the
`BeginQuit` event. Once registered, a message box is displayed before AutoCAD completely shutdown.

### C#

```
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices;
[CommandMethod("AddAppEvent")]
public void AddAppEvent()
{
  Application.SystemVariableChanged +=
      new Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.
          SystemVariableChangedEventHandler(appSysVarChanged);
}
 
[CommandMethod("RemoveAppEvent")]
public void RemoveAppEvent()
{
  Application.SystemVariableChanged -=
      new Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.
          SystemVariableChangedEventHandler(appSysVarChanged);
}
 
public void appSysVarChanged(object senderObj, 
                             Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.
                             SystemVariableChangedEventArgs sysVarChEvtArgs)
{
  object oVal = Application.GetSystemVariable(sysVarChEvtArgs.Name);
 
  // Display a message box with the system variable name and the new value
  Application.ShowAlertDialog(sysVarChEvtArgs.Name + " was changed." +
                              "\nNew value: " + oVal.ToString());
}
```

### VB.NET

```
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices
 
<CommandMethod("AddAppEvent")> _
Public Sub AddAppEvent()
  AddHandler Application.SystemVariableChanged, AddressOf appSysVarChanged
End Sub
 
<CommandMethod("RemoveAppEvent")> _
Public Sub RemoveAppEvent()
  RemoveHandler Application.SystemVariableChanged, AddressOf appSysVarChanged
End Sub
 
Public Sub appSysVarChanged(ByVal senderObj As Object, _
                            ByVal sysVarChEvtArgs As Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices. _
                            SystemVariableChangedEventArgs)
 
  Dim oVal As Object = Application.GetSystemVariable(sysVarChEvtArgs.Name)
 
  '' Display a message box with the system variable name and the new value
  Application.ShowAlertDialog(sysVarChEvtArgs.Name & " was changed." & _
                              vbLf & "New value: " & oVal.ToString())
End Sub
```

### VBA/ActiveX Code Reference

```
Public WithEvents ACADApp As AcadApplication
 
Sub Example_AcadApplication_Events()
    ' Intialize the public variable (ACADApp)
    '
    ' Run this procedure first
 
    Set ACADApp = ThisDrawing.Application
End Sub
 
Private Sub ACADApp_SysVarChanged(ByVal SysvarName As String, _
                                  ByVal newVal As Variant)
    ' This procedure intercepts an Application SysVarChanged event.
 
    MsgBox (SysvarName & " was changed." & _
            vbLf & "New value: " & newVal)
End Sub
```
