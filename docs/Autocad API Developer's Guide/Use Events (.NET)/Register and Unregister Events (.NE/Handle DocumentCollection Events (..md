# Handle DocumentCollection Events (.NET)

`DocumentCollection` object events are used to respond to the open documents in the application.
`DocumentCollection` events, unlike
`Document` object events, remain registered until AutoCAD is shutdown or until they are unregistered.

The following events are available for
`DocumentCollection` objects:

DocumentActivated
:   Triggered when a document window is activated.

DocumentActivationChanged
:   Triggered after the active document window is deactivated or destroyed.

DocumentBecameCurrent
:   Triggered when a document window is set current and is different from the previous active document window.

DocumentCreated
:   Triggered after a document window is created. Occurs after a new drawing is created or an existing drawing is opened.

DocumentCreateStarted
:   Triggered just before a document window is created. Occurs before a new drawing is created or an existing drawing is opened.

DocumentCreationCanceled
:   Triggered when a request to create a new drawing or to open an existing drawing is cancelled.

DocumentDestroyed
:   Triggered before a document window is destroyed and its associated database object is deleted.

DocumentLockModeChanged
:   Triggered after the lock mode of a document has changed.

DocumentLockModeChangeVetoed
:   Triggered after the lock mode change is vetoed.

DocumentLockModeWillChange
:   Triggered before the lock mode of a document is changed.

DocumentToBeActivated
:   Triggered when a document is about to be activated.

DocumentToBeDeactivated
:   Triggered when a document is about to be deactivated.

DocumentToBeDestroyed
:   Triggered when a document is about to be destroyed.

## Enable a DocumentCollection object event

The following example uses the
`DocumentActivated` event to indicate when a drawing window has been activated. A message box with the name of the drawing that is activated is displayed when the event occurs.

### C#

```
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices;
 
[CommandMethod("AddDocColEvent")]
public void AddDocColEvent()
{
  Application.DocumentManager.DocumentActivated +=
      new DocumentCollectionEventHandler(docColDocAct);
}
 
[CommandMethod("RemoveDocColEvent")]
public void RemoveDocColEvent()
{
  Application.DocumentManager.DocumentActivated -=
      new DocumentCollectionEventHandler(docColDocAct);
}
 
public void docColDocAct(object senderObj, 
                         DocumentCollectionEventArgs docColDocActEvtArgs)
{
  Application.ShowAlertDialog(docColDocActEvtArgs.Document.Name +
                              " was activated.");
}
```

### VB.NET

```
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime
Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices
 
<CommandMethod("AddDocColEvent")> _
Public Sub AddDocColEvent()
  AddHandler Application.DocumentManager.DocumentActivated, _
      AddressOf docColDocAct
End Sub
 
<CommandMethod("RemoveDocColEvent")> _
Public Sub RemoveDocColEvent()
  RemoveHandler Application.DocumentManager.DocumentActivated, _
      AddressOf docColDocAct
End Sub
 
Public Sub docColDocAct(ByVal senderObj As Object, _
                        ByVal docColDocActEvtArgs As DocumentCollectionEventArgs)
  Application.ShowAlertDialog(docColDocActEvtArgs.Document.Name & _
                              " was activated.")
End Sub
```

### VBA/ActiveX Code Reference

```
Private Sub AcadDocument_Activate()
    ' This example intercepts the Document Activate event.
 
    MsgBox ThisDrawing.Name & " was activated."
End Sub
```
