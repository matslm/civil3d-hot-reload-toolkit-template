# Define Blocks (.NET)

To create a new block, create a new
`BlockTableRecord` object and use the
`Add` method to append it to the
`BlockTable` object. Once you create a
`BlockTableRecord` object, use the
`Name` property to assign a name to the block and the objects to be displayed when the block is inserted into the drawing with the
`AppendEntity` method.

You then add any geometrical object, or another block, to the newly created
`BlockTableRecord` object. Objects are added to the
`BlockTableRecord` object with the
`AppendEntity` method. You can then insert an instance of the block into the drawing by creating a new
`BlockReference` object and appending it to model space or the
`BlockTableRecord` object that is associated with a Layout object. An inserted block is an object called a block reference.

You can also create a block by using the
`WBlock` method to write objects out to a separate drawing file. The drawing file can then be used as a block definition for other drawings. AutoCAD considers any drawing you insert into another drawing to be a block.

For more information on defining blocks, see “About Defining Blocks” in the product Help system.

## Define a block

This example defines a block and adds a circle to the block definition. It then inserts the block into the drawing as a block reference.

### C#

```
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices;
using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry;

[CommandMethod("CreatingABlock")]
public void CreatingABlock()
{
    // Get the current database and start a transaction
    Database acCurDb;
    acCurDb = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Database;

    using (Transaction acTrans = acCurDb.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())
    {
        // Open the Block table for read
        BlockTable acBlkTbl;
        acBlkTbl = acTrans.GetObject(acCurDb.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForRead) as BlockTable;

        if (!acBlkTbl.Has("CircleBlock"))
        {
            using (BlockTableRecord acBlkTblRec = new BlockTableRecord())
            {
                acBlkTblRec.Name = "CircleBlock";

                // Set the insertion point for the block
                acBlkTblRec.Origin = new Point3d(0, 0, 0);

                // Add a circle to the block
                using (Circle acCirc = new Circle())
                {
                    acCirc.Center = new Point3d(0, 0, 0);
                    acCirc.Radius = 2;

                    acBlkTblRec.AppendEntity(acCirc);

                    acTrans.GetObject(acCurDb.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForWrite);
                    acBlkTbl.Add(acBlkTblRec);
                    acTrans.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(acBlkTblRec, true);
                }
            }
        }

        // Save the new object to the database
        acTrans.Commit();

        // Dispose of the transaction
    }
}
```

                Using acCirc As New Circle
                    acCirc.Center = New Point3d(0, 0, 0)
                    acCirc.Radius = 2

                    acBlkTblRec.AppendEntity(acCirc)

                    acTrans.GetObject(acCurDb.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForWrite)
                    acBlkTbl.Add(acBlkTblRec)
                    acTrans.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(acBlkTblRec, True)
                End Using
            End Using
        End If

        ' Save the new object to the database
        acTrans.Commit()

        ' Dispose of the transaction
    End Using
End Sub
```

### VBA/ActiveX Code Reference

```
Sub CreatingABlock()
    ' Define the block
    Dim blockObj As AcadBlock
    Dim insertionPnt(0 To 2) As Double
    insertionPnt(0) = 0
    insertionPnt(1) = 0
    insertionPnt(2) = 0
    Set blockObj = ThisDrawing.Blocks.Add(insertionPnt, "CircleBlock")

    ' Add a circle to the block
    Dim center(0 To 2) As Double
    Dim radius As Double
    center(0) = 0
    center(1) = 0
    center(2) = 0
    rad = 2
    blockObj.AddCircle(center, rad)
End Sub
