# Attach and Scale a Raster Image (.NET)

Images can be attached and placed in a drawing file, but they are not actually part of the file. The image is linked to the drawing file through a path name or a data management document ID. Linked image paths can be changed or removed at any time. To attach an image, you first create a
`RasterImageDef` object which contains the definition information about the image file stored on disk being referenced and then you create a
`RasterImage` object.

Once you have created a
`RasterImageDef` object, you assign it to a
`RasterImage` object. The
`RasterImage` object represents the object you interact with in the drawing window and allows you to control the insertion point, scale, orientation, and appearance of the image among other properties. A single
`RasterImageDef` object can be used to attach an image multiple times. Each attachment has its own clip boundary and its own settings for brightness, contrast, fade, and transparency.

You can set the scale factor for a raster image with the Scale property after you create a
`RasterImage` object so that the image's geometry scale matches the scale of the geometry created in the AutoCAD drawing. When you attach an image, the image is inserted at a scale factor of 1 image unit of measurement to 1 AutoCAD unit of measurement. To set the image scale factor, you need to know the scale of the geometry on the image, and you need to know what unit of measurement (inches, feet, and so forth) you want to use to define 1 AutoCAD unit. The image file must contain resolution information defining the DPI, or dots per inch, and number of pixels in the image.

If an image has resolution information, AutoCAD combines it with the scale factor and the AutoCAD unit of measurement you supply to scale the image in your drawing. For example, if your raster image is a scanned blueprint on which the scale is 1 inch equals 50 feet, or 1:600, and your AutoCAD drawing is set up so that 1 unit represents 1 inch, then to set the scale factor of the image to 600. AutoCAD scales the image so the geometry in the image is brought into alignment with the vector geometry in the drawing.

Note: If no resolution information is defined with the attached image file, AutoCAD calculates the image's original width as one unit. After insertion, the image width in AutoCAD units is equal to the scale factor.

## Attach a raster image

This example adds a raster image in model space. This example uses the
*WorldMap.tif* file found in the VBA sample directory. If you do not have this image, or if it is located in a different directory, revise the code to use a valid path and file name.
