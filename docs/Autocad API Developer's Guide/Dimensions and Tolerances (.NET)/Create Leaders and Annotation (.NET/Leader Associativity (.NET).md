# Leader Associativity (.NET)

Leaders are associated with their annotation so that when the annotation moves, the endpoint of the leader moves with it. As you move text and feature control frame annotation, the final leader line segment alternates between attaching to the left side and to the right side of the annotation according to the relation of the annotation to the penultimate (second to last) point of the leader. If the midpoint of the annotation is to the right of the penultimate leader point, then the leader attaches to the right; otherwise, it attaches to the left.

Removing either object from the drawing using either the
`Erase`,
`Add` (to add a block), or
`WBlock` method will break associativity. If the leader and its annotation are copied together in a single operation, the new copy is associative. If they are copied separately, they will non-associative. If associativity is broken for any reason, for example, by copying only the Leader object or by erasing the annotation, the hook line will be removed from the leader.

## Associate a leader to the annotation

This example creates an
`MText` object. A leader line is then created using the
`MText` object as its annotation.
