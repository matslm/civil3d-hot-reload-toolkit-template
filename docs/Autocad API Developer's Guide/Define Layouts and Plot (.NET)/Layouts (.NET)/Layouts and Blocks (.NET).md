# Layouts and Blocks (.NET)

The content of any layout is distributed among two different objects: a Layout and `BlockTableRecord` object. The `Layout` object contains the plot settings and the visual properties of the layout as it appears in the AutoCAD user interface. The `BlockTableRecord` object contains the geometry that is displayed on the layout such as annotation, floating viewports, and title blocks. The `BlockTableRecord` object also includes the `Viewport` object that controls the display of the drafting aids and layer properties used for the layout.

Each Layout object is associated with one, and only one, `BlockTableRecord` object. To access the `BlockTableRecord` object associated with a given layout, use the `BlockTableRecordId` property. Conversely, each `BlockTableRecord` object is associated with one, and only one, `Layout` object. To access the Layout object associated with a given BlockTableRecord, use the `LayoutId` property for that block. The `IsLayout` property of a `BlockTableRecord` can be used to determine if it has an associated `Layout` object; `TRUE` is returned if the `BlockTableRecord` is associated with a `Layout` object.
