# Plot Area (.NET)

When a layout is plotted, the area in which is plotted is determined by the `PlotType` property. The value stored in the `PlotType` property is one of the values defined by the `PlotType` enum. The `PlotType` enum defines the following values:

Display
:   Prints everything that is in the current model space display. This option is unavailable when plotting from a Paper space layout.

Extents
:   Prints everything that falls within the boundaries of the currently selected space.

Limits
:   Prints everything that is in the limits of the current space.

View
:   Prints the view named by the `PlotViewName` property.

Window
:   Prints everything in the window specified by the `PlotWindowArea` property.

Layout
:   Prints everything that falls within the margins of the specified paper size. This option is not available when printing from Model space.

When you create a new Paper space layout, the default option is Layout.
