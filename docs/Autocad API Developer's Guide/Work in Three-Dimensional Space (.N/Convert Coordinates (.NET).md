# Convert Coordinates (.NET)

The
`TransformBy` method can translate a point or a displacement from one coordinate system to another. You use the
`AlignCoordinateSystem` method to specify which coordinate system you are translating from and which coordinate system you are going to. The
`AlignCoordinateSystem` method requires the following:

* Origin point of the coordinate system you are translating from
* Three 3D vectors that represent the X, Y and X axes of the coordinate system you are translating from
* Origin point of the coordinate system you are translating to
* Three 3D vectors that represent the X, Y and X axes of the coordinate system you are translating to

WCS
:   World coordinate system: The reference coordinate system. All other coordinate systems are defined relative to the WCS, which never changes. Values measured relative to the WCS are stable across changes to other coordinate systems. All points passed in and out of the methods and properties in the .NET API are expressed in the WCS unless otherwise specified.

UCS
:   User coordinate system (UCS): The working coordinate system. The user specifies a UCS to make drawing tasks easier. All points passed to AutoCAD commands, including those returned from AutoLISP routines and external functions, are points in the current UCS (unless the user precedes them with an \* at the Command prompt). If you want your application to send coordinates in the WCS, OCS, or DCS to AutoCAD commands, you must first convert them to the UCS by calling the translating them and then transforming the Point3d or Point 2d object with the
    `TransformBy` method that represents the coordinate value.

OCS
:   Object coordinate system (also known as Entity coordinate system or ECS): Point values specified by certain methods and properties for the Polyline2d and Polyline objects are expressed in this coordinate system, relative to the object. These points are usually converted into the WCS, current UCS, or current DCS, according to the intended use of the object. Conversely, points in WCS, UCS, or DCS must be translated into an OCS before they are written to the database by means of the same properties.

    When converting coordinates to or from the OCS you must consider the normal of the OCS.

DCS
:   Display coordinate system: The coordinate system where objects are transformed before they are displayed. The origin of the DCS is the point stored in the AutoCAD system variable TARGET, and its
    *Z* axis is the viewing direction. In other words, a viewport is always a plan view of its DCS. These coordinates can be used to determine where something will be displayed to the user.

PSDCS
:   Paper space DCS: This coordinate system can be transformed only to or from the DCS of a Model space viewport. This is essentially a 2D transformation, where the
    *X* and
    *Y* coordinates are always scaled. Therefore, it can be used to find the scale factor between the two coordinate systems. The PSDCS can be transformed only into a Model space viewport.

## Translate OCS coordinates to WCS coordinates

This example creates a polyline in Model space. The first vertex for the polyline is then displayed in both the OCS and WCS coordinates.
