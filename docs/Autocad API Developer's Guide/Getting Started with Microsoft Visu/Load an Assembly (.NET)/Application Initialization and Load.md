# Application Initialization and Load-Time Optimization (.NET)

Managed applications can choose to perform initialization or termination tasks by implementing the optional
`Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.IExtensionApplication` interface.

The interface
`Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.IExtensionApplication` provides the
`Initialize()` and
`Terminate()` methods. Since managed applications cannot be manually unloaded, any implementation of the
`Terminate()` method is called when the AutoCAD program closes.

If your application defines a large number of data types, you can optimize its load-time performance by implementing
`IExtensionApplication` and using two optional custom attributes. These attributes—`ExtensionApplication` and
`CommandClass`—help the AutoCAD program find the application's initialization routine and command handlers.

Any managed application can use these attributes. However, their optimizing effects are measurable only in larger applications.

## Use the ExtensionApplication and CommandClass Attributes

When the AutoCAD program loads a managed application, it queries the application's assembly for an
`ExtensionApplication` attribute. If this attribute is found, the AutoCAD program sets the attribute's associated type as the application's entry point. If no such attribute is found, AutoCAD searches all exported types for an
`IExtensionApplication` implementation. If no implementation is found, the AutoCAD program skips the application-specific initialization step.

The
`ExtensionApplication` attribute can be attached to only one type. The type to which it is attached must implement the
`IExtensionApplication` interface.

In addition to searching for an implementation of
`IExtensionApplication` in an application, the AutoCAD program queries the application's assembly for one or more
`CommandClass` attributes. If instances of this attribute are found, the AutoCAD program searches only their associated types for command methods. Otherwise, it searches all exported types.

A
`CommandClass` attribute may be declared for any type that defines an AutoCAD command handler. If an application uses the
`CommandClass` attribute, it must declare an instance of this attribute for every type that contains an AutoCAD command handler method.

The following procedure describes how these attributes are used.

1. Define a type that implements
   `Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.IExtensionApplication`.

   If you do not need to perform initialization or termination tasks, provide blank implementations of the interface methods.
2. In the assembly context, declare an
   `ExtensionApplication` attribute.
3. Pass the type that implements the
   `IExtensionApplication` interface to the
   `ExtensionApplication` attribute.
4. In the assembly context, declare a
   `CommandClass` attribute for each class that defines AutoCAD command methods.
5. Pass the type of the command method's class to the
   `CommandClass` attribute.

Note: These attributes must be declared in the assembly context.

    {
        // Defines a command that prompts a message on the AutoCAD
        // command line.

        ' command line.
