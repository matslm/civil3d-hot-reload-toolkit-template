# The Application Object (.NET)

The `Application` object is the root object of the AutoCAD .NET API. From the Application object, you can access the main window as well as any open drawing. Once you have a drawing, you can then access the objects in the drawing.

For example, the `Application` object has a `DocumentManager` property that returns the `DocumentCollection` object. This object provides access to the drawings that are currently open in AutoCAD and allows you to create, save and open drawing files. Other properties of the Application object provide access to the application-specific data such as InfoCenter, the main window, and the status bar. The `MainWindow` property allows access to the application name, size, location, and visibility.

While most of the properties of the Application object allow access to objects in the AutoCAD .NET API, there are some that reference objects in the AutoCAD ActiveX® Automation. These properties include a COM version of the application object (`AcadApplication`), the menubar (`MenuBar`), loaded menugroups (`MenuGroups`), and preferences (`Preferences`).
