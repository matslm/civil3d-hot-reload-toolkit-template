# The Collection Objects (.NET)

AutoCAD groups most graphical and non-graphical objects into collections or container objects. Although collections contain different types of data, they can be processed using similar techniques. Each collection has a method for adding an object to or obtaining an item from a collection. Most collections use the `Add` or `SetAt` methods to add an object to a collection.

Most collections offer similar methods and properties to make them easy to use and learn. The `Count` property returns a zero-based count of the objects in a collection, while the Item function returns an object from a collection. Examples of collection members in the AutoCAD .NET API are:

* Layer table record in the Layers symbol table
* Layout in the ACAD\_LAYOUT dictionary
* Document in the DocumentCollection
* Attributes in a block reference
