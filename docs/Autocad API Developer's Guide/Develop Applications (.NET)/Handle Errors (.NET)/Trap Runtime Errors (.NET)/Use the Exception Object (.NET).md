# Use the Exception Object (.NET)

The
`Exception` object is used to obtain information about the error trapped with the
`Catch` clause of a
`Try` statement. The
`Exception` object used for the AutoCAD .NET API is based on the
`Exception` object of the Microsoft® .NET. To determine the error that is trapped by the
`Catch` clause, you can use the properties of the
`Exception` object. Some of the member properties of the
`Exception` object that you can get information about the error are:

* **ErrorStatus** - Returns the
  `Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.ErrorStatus` enum value assigned to the exception.
* **Message** - Returns a text message that explains the exception.
* **Source** - Returns the application or object that caused the exception.
* **StackTrace** - Returns a string representation of the frames on the call stack when the exception occurred.
* **TargetSite** - Returns the method that threw the exception.
